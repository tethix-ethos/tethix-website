        In the embrace of Earth's timeless wisdom, we honor the Sacred Custodians of lands that stretch across Australia's vast horizons, and to the seas and communities that pulse with life. We extend a hand of respect to the wise elders who have walked before us and those who walk with us today, among the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Our acknowledgment weaves further, to indigenous communities globally, whose lands cradle the veins of our interconnected digital world. We recognise the enduring echoes of the past and the ripples of the present that continue to shape the homes and hearts of these sacred peoples.
