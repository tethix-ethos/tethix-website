title: Pathfinders Newmoonsletter, October 2023
date: 2023-10-14
description: As the new moon rises, we plant pledges, come together for collective futurecrafting, and imagine rainbows mirrors for existential hope.
---

<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>With this Newmoonsletter, crafted around the Tethix campfire, we invite you to join other Pathfinders as we reflect
  on celestial movements in tech in the previous lunar cycle, water our ETHOS Gardens, and plant seeds of intentions for
  the new cycle that begins today.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Weather Report</strong></h2>
<p><strong>üå´Ô∏è Current conditions: foggy with low visibility.</strong></p>
<p>The fog brought on by the fire apprentices' experiments with AI golems persists. The Ministries of Magic around the
  world are trying to deploy their regulations to herd the golems and attempt to clear the fog that is causing mass
  anxiety and uncertainty. There seems to be general agreement that the golem problem is out of control, yet we‚Äôre
  waiting for the Ministries to tell us what to do. <em>(See <a
      href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/everyone-wants-responsible-ai-but-few-people-are-doing-anything-about-it/">Everyone
      wants responsible AI, but few people are doing anything about it</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the AI golems are multiplying and roaming around unchecked, becoming more human-like every day. Caution is
  advised if you plan to venture outside and seek paths in this thick fog. We've heard reports of golems running over
  pedestrians in their gas guzzling SUVs amidst reports of water shortages near the alleged locations of golem-producing
  kilns. <em>(See<a href="https://phys.org/news/2023-09-artificial-intelligence-technology-chatgpt-built.html">
      Artificial intelligence technology behind ChatGPT was built in Iowa‚Äîwith a lot of water</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Also beware of tricksters posing as Pathfinders, trying to seduce you with maps spanning 100+ pages in PDF. Often the
  scale of these maps is all wrong, possibly of the wrong place, with legends written in ancient Sumerian, so we advise
  you not to rely on trickster maps for your pathfinding. You might also stumble upon compasses that point to
  responsible AI principles. Keep in mind that while a sense of direction is important, you also need to figure out
  where your destination is. Our Elemental Workshops can help you better connect to the land and strengthen your
  pathfinding skills and reduce over-reliance on navigational artefacts of questionable origin. <em>(See <a
      href="https://tethix.co/workshops">Tethix Elemental Workshops</a>, use code EARLY for a 30% discount until Oct
    23.)</em></p>
<p>But fear not, we are hearing reports of villagers successful chasing away some of the golems with the might of their
  pens and collective organising, so there is hope for humanity yet when we come together. <em>(See <a
      href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/oct/01/hollywood-writers-strike-artificial-intelligence">How
      Hollywood writers triumphed over AI ‚Äì and why it matters</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Keep your hopes up, Pathfinders. The fog will clear away.</p>

<p>It seems we‚Äôre all trying to figure out what gen AI is actually for. Writing code definitely appears like a forte,
  and some say it might turn <a
    href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/04/2023/ai-is-spurring-the-rise-of-the-novice-coder">everyone into a
    developer</a> ‚Äì all in the name of increased productivity ‚Äì, while Silicon Valley is trying to improve the <a

    skills</a>. Meanwhile, <a

    Sutskever calls deep learning ‚Äòalchemy‚Äô</a>, and weirdly <a

    Emerald podcast</a>, which explores AI through stories and myths, is the one that makes the most sense.</p>
<p>AI challenges our views on humanity, intelligence, consciousness, creativity. The AI golems and the men behind the
  curtain who brought them to life all say they just want to help, but this new fire is spreading faster than we can
  make sense of it.</p>
<p>Our response to feeling lost in the AI fog was to design <a href="https://tethix.co/workshops/">Elemental
    Workshops</a> that explore generative AI beyond productivity and the usual hype and harms narratives. We‚Äôre
  approaching this new fire with both caution and curiosity. It‚Äôs clear we‚Äôre going to have to build a firepit to
  contain it, yet we also think it can help us learn more about our humanity.</p>
<p>And while the AI fire holds our attention these days, it certainly isn‚Äôt the only fire you should worry about when
  trying to build better products. Responsibility is more than just Responsible AI. And responsible product development
  isn‚Äôt just about ticking compliance checkboxes, but thinking about product development as more than just a fire
  practice.</p>
<p>Which is why we‚Äôre trying to bring attention to other elements with our <a
    href="https://tethix.co/elemental-ethics/">Elemental Ethics</a> framework. Alja explores how your day-to-day
  practice will change if your organisation decides to embrace responsible firekeeping in the blog post <a
    href="https://tethix.co/fire/day-in-the-life-of-a-responsible-firekeeper-your-journey-from-installing-to-embodying-ethos/">Day
    in the life of a responsible firekeeper: your journey from installing to embodying ETHOS</a>. The path to hell is
  laid with good intentions, but we think the path to responsible products is laid with actionable pledges that balance
  fire with other elements.</p>
<h3 class="air">Air seeds to improve the flow of Collaboration</h3>
<a href="https://tethix.co/air/welcome-to-the-tethix-archipelago-an-experiment-in-using-virtual-spaces-for-learning-and-collaboration/"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/feature-img_Tethix-Archipelago.png" alt="Screenshots of various places in the Tethix Archipelago, a virtual 2D collaborative pixel world."></a>
<p>In addition to having good intentions, one of the many things that sets humans apart from AI agents is our bodily
  connection to place. But we can also use our innate spatial abilities in digital spaces, a topic Alja explored in the
  blog post ‚Äì and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAdv1goEZJs">companion video</a> ‚Äì <a
    href="https://tethix.co/air/welcome-to-the-tethix-archipelago-an-experiment-in-using-virtual-spaces-for-learning-and-collaboration/">Welcome
    to the Tethix Archipelago: an experiment in using virtual spaces for learning and collaboration</a>.</p>
<p>The digital tools we use every day in our practice are also digital places with their own stories. And sadly, the
  story we too often hear is the one of personal productivity, even competition. We wonder what our digital tools would
  look like if we shifted towards <a
    href="https://blog.ialja.com/2023/06/06/our-world-needs-more-collaborative-experience-design/">Collaborative
    Experience Design</a>. Instead of having private sessions with ChatGPT, imagine what we could do if AI tools were
  designed to help us collaborate, connect, and develop shared understandings.</p>
<p>Instead, digital spaces often push us further from each other, disconnecting us from <a
    href="https://designforsustainability.medium.com/indigenous-to-life-coming-home-to-place-68915e91eb2">Earth
    wisdom</a>. Virtual offices try to mimic physical offices we hate, instead of finding joy in designing for our
  imagination. We keep hearing echoes of the story of productivity and efficiency in the tools we reluctantly use to get
  the job done.</p>
<p>What gives us hope is that different stories are emerging all over the place. In Australia, the <a
    href="https://consult.industry.gov.au/sciencepriorities2">draft science and research priorities</a> are sprinkled
  with sparks of magic. Indigenous knowledge and knowledge systems, which include stories that have been situated in
  place and shaped by Country for 60,000+ years, are now being considered as a grounding for nationwide transformation
  over the next decade.</p>
<p>In response to this, Mat, Nate, and a couple of Australian colleagues proposed the Collective Futurecrafting
  Initiative. This proposal comes from a deep consideration for systemic interconnectedness, planetary boundaries, as
  well as care for local communities and human thriving. It comes from a place that is existentially hopeful, and our
  attempt at <a href="https://tethix.co/air/rising-to-the-biggest-challenge-of-our-time/">Rising to the biggest
    challenge of our time: Australia‚Äôs duty of care to collectively re-imagine and re-design our nation</a>.</p>
<h3 class="earth">Earth seeds to ground you in Research</h3>

<p>And while we love telling stories around the campfire, we also find immense value in grounding ourselves in research
  from different disciplines. Nate takes a closer look at the assumptions behind the Agile Manifesto in the blog post <a
    href="https://tethix.co/earth/beyond-the-agile-manifesto-a-new-paradigm-for-responsible-product-development/">Beyond
    the Agile Manifesto: A new paradigm for responsible product development</a>. On the RSA blog, Nate also writes about
  <a href="https://www.thersa.org/comment/2023/10/three-reasons-why-ai-ethics-is-struggling">Three reasons why AI ethics
    is struggling</a> and explores how we might close the ethical intent to action gap by drawing inspiration from a
  model from the cognitive sciences.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thersa.org/">The RSA</a> is the royal society for the encouragement of arts, manufactures and
  commerce. It‚Äôs a non-profit with a 260 year history, and its mission is about <a
    href="https://www.thersa.org/design-for-life-our-mission">design for life</a>. Nate is one of over 30,000 global
  fellows working across disciplines to support regenerative initiatives that bring human life back within planetary
  boundaries, whilst also raising the social ceiling for those who need it most. Their <a
    href="https://www.thersa.org/blog/2023/10/a-vitality-scale-towards-a-regenerative-world">vitality scale towards a
    regenerative world</a> is definitely worth checking out (Nate has already suggested a few potential improvements).
  If you prefer to tune in with your ears, the <a href="https://rsa-podcasts.simplecast.com/">RSA Podcast</a> offers
  excellent seeds of inspiration, such as the special series episode on <a
    href="https://rsa-podcasts.simplecast.com/episodes/special-series-future-dreaming">Future Dreaming</a>.</p>
<p>We were also excited to read about the emerging <a
    href="https://medium.com/@teemu.koskimaki/scientific-consensus-on-post-growth-over-green-growth-196d3a4f74ff">Scientific
    Consensus on Post-Growth over Green Growth</a> ‚Äì the story of unlimited growth (in the ways we currently think about
  it) no longer makes sense. In fact, it hasn‚Äôt since the 70s! <a href="https://tippingpoint-podcast.com/about/">This
    podcast</a> covering the story of the Limits to Growth is worth listening to as well.</p>
<p>And we have to be mindful of the stories we tell. Recent research shows the <a
    href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/24/5243">impact of imagined future events on our brain</a>. Considering
  the swathe of dystopian imagery in our media and memescape, this hints at the neurological basis for our struggle to
  imagine techno-moral futures that are more positive. To help us widen the space of possible futures ‚Äì and improve our
  collective futurecrafting ‚Äì, we might use frameworks like the <a
    href="https://thevoroscope.com/2017/02/24/the-futures-cone-use-and-history/">Futures Cone</a> to increase the
  vividness of what‚Äôs possible and thus make preferable futures more probable.</p>

<p>In tech, dystopian Black Mirrors dominate our imagined futures. We would like to challenge this view with rainbow
  mirrors, as Mat explores in the blog post <a
    href="https://tethix.co/water/rainbow-mirrors-technology-and-our-collective-moral-imagination/">Rainbow mirrors:
    technology and our collective moral imagination</a>. We need to imagine alternatives that aren‚Äôt all doom and gloom,
