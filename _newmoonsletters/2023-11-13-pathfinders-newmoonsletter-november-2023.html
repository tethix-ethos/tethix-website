title: Pathfinders Newmoonsletter, November 2023
date: 2023-11-13
description: As the new moon rises, we look for fogbows amidst the AI fog and climate doom by shining a mythopoetic light on perspectives often ignored, inspired by ancient wisdom and love for life on planet Earth.
---

<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>With this Newmoonsletter, crafted around the Tethix campfire, we invite you to join other Pathfinders as we reflect
  on celestial movements in tech in the previous lunar cycle, water our ETHOS Gardens, and plant seeds of intentions for
  the new cycle that begins today.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Weather Report</strong></h2>
<p><strong>üå´Ô∏è Current conditions:&nbsp;the fog thickens.</strong></p>
<p><em>‚ÄúLife on planet Earth is under siege‚Äù</em>: these words of warning open the latest of climate reports. Meanwhile,
  the fog that‚Äôs seeding uncertainty and division is thickening. And the fire apprentices have convinced the Ministries
  of Magic that their AI golems, which are contributing to the fog, are also the solution to the fog. Doesn‚Äôt make much
  sense? Don‚Äôt worry about it, it makes money and helps everyone forget that apprentices ‚Äì who still change their core
  values overnight ‚Äì aren‚Äôt supposed to be in charge.&nbsp;<em>(See&nbsp;<a
      href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biad080/7319571">The 2023 state of
      the climate report: Entering uncharted territory</a>. and&nbsp;<a
      href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-core-values-agi">The Ever-So-Ethical OpenAI Just Replaced Its "Core
      Values" With Completely Different Ones</a>)</em></p>
<p>The Ministries of Magic around the world feel mighty good that they‚Äôve finally signed a document saying we all care
  about AI golem safety and about the people whom the fog is affecting. A new Institute for Golem Magic should help you
  sleep better at night -at least until the next extreme weather alert wakes you up. In the land of the golems, a new
  executive order has been issued that envisions better golem testing, yet also omits the impact the golems have on the
  climate (among other issues).&nbsp;<em>(See&nbsp;<a
      href="https://theconversation.com/bletchley-declaration-international-agreement-on-ai-safety-is-a-good-start-but-ordinary-people-need-a-say-not-just-elites-217042">Bletchley
      declaration: international agreement on AI safety is a good start, but ordinary people need a say ‚Äì not just
      elites</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/01/unpacking-bidens-ai-executive-order">What's in
      Biden's AI executive order ‚Äî and what's not</a>.)</em></p>
<p>To better understand this persistent fog, we recommend spending less time following and reacting to headlines that
  tend to intensify the fog in one‚Äôs head. Instead, we prescribe a healthy dose of listening and spreading the work of
  fog experts and poets who have been defying the golem makers by dissecting their creations and studying the direct
  effects the golems and the fog are already having on people‚Äôs lives.&nbsp;<em>(Watch&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sasha_luccioni_ai_is_dangerous_but_not_for_the_reasons_you_think">AI is dangerous,
      but not for the reasons you think</a>&nbsp;and read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unmasking.ai/">Unmasking
      AI</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Amidst this thickening fog, it might be getting harder to get enough vitamin D, but we do hope that the seeds we‚Äôve
  collected in this past moon help you find some sunshine. We are hearing stories about collective imagination
  dispersing the fog and even sightings of&nbsp;<a href="https://earthsky.org/earth/what-is-a-fogbow/">fogbows</a>, so
  don‚Äôt surrender to the fog just yet, Pathfinder. There is much to do to protect life on planet Earth.</p>

<p>OpenAI, the company that changes core values like socks, has partnered with Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft to form
  the&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/blog/frontier-model-forum">Frontier Model Forum</a>&nbsp;and launch a new $10
  million&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/blog/frontier-model-forum-updates">AI Safety Fund</a>. Still no funding
  announced to study or reveal the environmental impacts of the foundation models these companies are unleashing onto
  the world. But you‚Äôll soon be able to build and monetize&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts">your

    Poe</a>&nbsp;creator monetization program or other marketplaces, and increase your environmental footprint by an
  unknown amount. Prompt engineering is so last month, monetizing AI chatbots is the next frontier!</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not that we‚Äôre against AI development, but given the increasing severity of climate reports, we‚Äôd really like to
  see these companies take some responsibility regarding the environmental impact of using LLMs to write bad jokes or
  generic marketing copy. This would give us the ability to take environmental costs into account when choosing which
  models to use, both as end-users or when developing AI-powered products.</p>
<p>Even Mozilla‚Äôs recently released&nbsp;<a
    href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/introducing-mozillas-ai-guide-the-developers-onboarding-ramp-to-ai/?n=@">AI
    Guide</a>, which promotes the use of open-source models, doesn‚Äôt emphasize environmental costs in their&nbsp;<a

    href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a>, the platform for open-source AI development, is currently ahead of
  the pack by offering resources to&nbsp;<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards-co2">report carbon

    href="https://huggingface.co/blog/carbon-emissions-on-the-hub">find low-emission models</a>. (And yes, carbon
  emissions aren‚Äôt everything, but we‚Äôve got to start somewhere.)</p>
<p>We‚Äôll certainly bring attention to this and other ignored perspectives in the AI space in the <a

<p>With everything happening so fast in the AI space, it might be tempting to move fast and break things. In the blog
  post&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.co/fire/taking-the-scenic-route-in-product-development/">Taking the scenic route in
    product development</a>, Alja reminds us that blindly following the GPS and taking the fastest route doesn‚Äôt always
  lead us to the right destination. Even though the fire of AI appears enticingly warm and bright, there is value in
  taking detours with moral imagination and exploring paths that are currently hidden or not taken.</p>
<h3 class="air">Air seeds to improve the flow of Collaboration</h3>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnMN9L1L2s"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rainbow-mirrors.png" alt="An illustration of three rainbow mirrors showing different images"></a>
<p>Another aspect we‚Äôre missing from a lot of the debates on AI is collaboration. AI principles are often developed
  top-down, without the involvement of diverse stakeholders ‚Äì human and non-human. This is a topic Nate and Mat explored
  in the presentation&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygnMN9L1L2s">Can a culture that supports
    participatory ethics enhance diversity and inclusion in AI development?</a>&nbsp;delivered at the recent&nbsp;<a
    href="https://sites.google.com/view/di-in-ai-symposium23/home">CSIRO Symposium for Diversity and Inclusion in
    AI</a>.</p>
<p>The symposium had some wonderful research presented, but a standout for us was Rebecca Johnson's ‚Äò<a
    href="https://sts4ir.com/2023/10/18/paws-and-perspectives-inclusivity-in-genai-evaluation-design/">Paws and
    perspectives: Fostering inclusivity in Generative AI Model Evaluation</a>‚Äô ‚Äì but maybe we‚Äôre just biased as cat
  people. (Dogs are obviously pawsome too!)</p>
<p>The stories we tell ‚Äì even ones of cats vs. dogs ‚Äì are so often framed in competitive terms. This is one of a few
  criticisms we have of the recent, and mostly brilliant, Netflix docuseries&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/life-on-our-planet-release-date-news-trailer">Life on Our Planet</a>.
  It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, which is perhaps enough of a reason to watch. The focus is life through the lens of
  the five previous mass extinction events, basically defined as events or circumstances that lead to greater than 75%
  of life on earth being permanently lost.</p>
<p>Freeman frequently repeats that life is defined by competition. But life really doesn‚Äôt seem to be defined only by
  competition ‚Äì and you can love both cats and dogs, as we do! Ecologies are inherently relational. Within this
  relational context, there is competition, coopetition, and real collaboration. Consider this next time you‚Äôre
  pondering ‚Äúour nature‚Äù.</p>
<p>Oh, and ‚Äì spoiler alert! ‚Äì we‚Äôre in the late stages of the sixth mass extinction event, with greater than 70% of
  wildlife being lost in just the last 50 years. This is almost exclusively attributed to human activities, thanks to
  the fact that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2306987120">current extinction rates are 35 times
    higher than expected background rates</a>. Yikes.</p>
<p>Freeman suggests that our intelligence will be the key to solving these problems. But this doesn‚Äôt ring true. It‚Äôll
  be our capacity to act with deep care and genuine wisdom, something that is sorely lacking in our current society.</p>
<p>And we are not just in a relationship with each other, but with the rest of the community of life, a living planet,
  as Daniel Christian Wahl explored in the excerpt&nbsp;<a
    href="https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/being-a-process-and-seeing-in-relationships-859eb17f6bfb">Being a process,
    and seeing in relationships</a>.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, we still tend to forget that humans are an especially collaborative species, full of imagination
  not just when it comes to destruction, but also collaboration. The internet is proof of our collaborative superpowers,
  and this past moon we were also inspired by the discussion with Nafeez Ahmed in the Planet: Critical episode&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.planetcritical.com/p/the-interconnected-grid-nafeez-ahmed#details">The Interconnected Grid</a>.
  Rather than competing for energy, we could connect to a grid that allows for sharing of energy to meet local demands
  and reduce the need for battery storage. The interconnected grid is just one piece of infrastructure we could build
  to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.planetcritical.com/p/how-to-break-out-of-a-simulation">break out of a simulation</a>, as
  Planet: Critical‚Äôs host Rachel Donald explores in a follow-up post.</p>
<h3 class="earth">Earth seeds to ground you in Research</h3>
<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/mythopoetic-sense-making-of-our-ai-future-tickets-750251561617" ><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/workshop-moral-imagineering-with-chatgpt_ft-img.jpg" alt="An illustration of a golem holding a tablet"></a>
<p>Given the state of the climate and the current AI fog, it‚Äôs pretty clear we‚Äôll have to rethink the stories we tell.
  Exploring the stories that came before can also help us increase our possibility space and feed our moral imagination.
  The paper&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-21448-6_2">Artificial Intelligence:
    Definition and Background</a>&nbsp;takes a deeper dive into the definition and history of AI, including the mythical
  representations of AI in different cultures. This is something we‚Äôll explore during the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/mythopoetic-sense-making-of-our-ai-future-tickets-750251561617">mythopoetic
    sense-making</a>&nbsp;event as part of AI Month, and we do like to use the myth of golems to explore our complicated
  relationship with AI.</p>
<p>If you want to dig deeper into a lesser known myth that also serves as a cautionary tale, we recommend&nbsp;<a
    href="https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/krattai-estonias-national-artificial-intelligence-strategy">reading
    about the Estonian myth of Kratt</a>&nbsp;‚Äì a magical household helper that turns onto its owner if it's not kept
  busy ‚Äì and how it led to KrattAI, Estonia‚Äôs AI National Strategy.</p>
<p>As well as learning from past stories, it‚Äôs important to examine the new stories AI models ‚Äì and their makers ‚Äì are
  telling us. Rest of World recently analyzed 3,000 AI-generated images to explore&nbsp;<a
    href="https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-image-stereotypes/">cultural stereotypes and bias</a>. These types of
  explorations are important given the low transparency scores achieved by AI developers in&nbsp;<a
    href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/fmti/">The Foundation Model Transparency Index&nbsp;</a>research. Unfortunately,
  these are not surprising results for companies that pride themselves on moving fast and breaking things.</p>
<p>And it appears that even the models themselves feel the pressure, as new research explores how adding&nbsp;<a
    href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11760">emotional stimuli</a>&nbsp;(such as telling a model that the prompt is
  important for your career) boosts the model‚Äôs performance. Jokes aside, we still have a lot to learn about how LLMs
  work, how they can be used to optimize their own prompts ‚Äì which apparently even leads to prompting each other
  to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://venturebeat.com/business/deepmind-discovers-that-ai-large-language-models-can-optimize-their-own-prompts/">‚Äútake
    a deep breath‚Äù</a>&nbsp;‚Äì and using larger models to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/03/2023/new-synthetic-data-techniques-could-change-the-way-ai-models-are-trained">train
    smaller ones</a>. Well, at least smaller models might be better for the environment, though we suspect we‚Äôll just
  find ways to use more of them ‚Äì&nbsp;<a

<p>But wait! We also promised you seeds of hope, and in that spirit, we invite you to immerse and ground yourself in the
  booklet&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0026/1823318/Seeding-Futures-for-Wellbeing_GCSI.pdf">Seeding
    Futures for Wellbeing</a>&nbsp;by the Griffith Centre for Systems Innovation. The booklet was designed as a
  collective imagination starter pack, weaving together diverse questions and perspectives to train your futurecrafting
  skills.</p>
<h3 class="water">Water seeds to deepen your Reflection</h3>
<a href="https://tethix.co/water/discovering-stories-about-digital-workplaces-like-slack-that-can-cultivate-a-culture-of-collective-wisdom-and-care/"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/feature-img_workplace-stories.png" alt="Illustration of four people sitting around a campfire, each person with a place influencing their thoughts. The fire in the campfire is an app that represents ETHOS Gardening based on the Elemental Ethics framework."></a>
<p>The future is indeed not set in stone yet. We have the power ‚Äì and responsibility ‚Äì to explore and tell different
  stories. If you‚Äôre interested in exploring and reflecting on the stories we tell about our digital workplaces, we
  invite you to read our recent blog post&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.co/water/discovering-stories-about-digital-workplaces-like-slack-that-can-cultivate-a-culture-of-collective-wisdom-and-care/">Discovering
    stories about digital workplaces like Slack that can cultivate a culture of collective wisdom and care</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the Newmoonsletter is all about planting seeds, and we consider ourselves lucky that seeds of reflection,
  grounding, collaboration, and practice are fairly abundant and easy to come by. Seed farming in the physical world
  is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/16/seed-farmers-climate-change">becoming
    harder</a>&nbsp;though due to increasingly chaotic climate conditions. As with many things, supporting local and
  small seed companies seems to be a good practice when looking for seeds for your garden.</p>
<p>When it comes to adapting our lives to the changing climate, we could certainly learn a lesson or two from indigenous
  people, who have lived with their lands for tens of thousands of years. If you‚Äôre looking for a starting point ‚Äì or
  just a bit of inspiration ‚Äì start with the&nbsp;<a

    Fire</a>&nbsp;podcast (other episodes are worth listening to as well).</p>
<p>We do like to compare technology to fire. In preparation for the upcoming&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/mythopoetic-sense-making-of-our-ai-future-tickets-750251561617">mythopoetic

    href="https://www.fire.nsw.gov.au/gallery/files/pdf/publications/Traditional%20fire%20stories.pdf">Traditional fire
    stories</a>&nbsp;compiled by Fire and Rescue NSW in Australia. This is a wonderful collection of stories that you
  might read with your children and perhaps be inspired to reflect on our relationship with technology ‚Äì the fire.</p>
<p>The theft of fire for the benefit of humanity is a common theme in many mythologies. If we think of AI as stolen
  fire, we can open interesting discussions: who was the fire of AI stolen from? Why was somebody guarding the fire, why
  didn‚Äôt they trust the humans? What are the benefits and risks of open-sourcing the fire, making it available to
  everyone?</p>
<p>You can join us in an exploration of questions like this during our <a
    href="https://tethix.co/earth/tethix-events-for-australias-ai-month-2023/">AI Month events</a>. And if you need a
  break from all the AI news and climate doom, we want to remind you that we‚Äôre all living on a rock flying through
  space. And that there‚Äôs so much more than AI to learn about and be in awe of. For instance, a&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-bennu-asteroid-sample-contains-carbon-water/#:~:text=Initial%20studies%20of%20the%204.5,be%20found%20in%20the%20rock.">NASA
    asteroid sample</a>&nbsp;has been found to contain water and carbon, the building blocks for life. The James Webb
  Space Telescope (JWST) continues to make&nbsp;<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb#Latest-News">fascinating
    observations</a>, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66974738">pairs of planet-like
    objects</a>&nbsp;in the Orion Nebula that we cannot quite explain with our current understanding of astronomy.</p>
<p>And to bring it back home to Spaceship Earth, a reminder that oceans cover more than 70% of our planet‚Äôs surface, yet
  over 80% of them remain unexplored, with NASA now&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220111-why-nasa-is-exploring-the-deepest-oceans-on-earth">venturing into
    the deep unknowns</a>&nbsp;of our own planet. Perhaps we should all acknowledge how much we still don‚Äôt know and can
  learn from each other and the Universe. Instead of pretending that the latest technology we‚Äôre building has all the
  solutions to problems we don‚Äôt fully understand yet.</p>

<h3>Moonthly Pathfinding Seeds to plant &amp; share</h3>
<p>What a rollercoaster ride is to try to do good in this climate, eh? Well, we believe good intentions still need to be
  nurtured and that small actions can have compounding effects.</p>
<p>Which is why we started planting Pathfinding Seeds on&nbsp;<a
    href="https://linkedin.com/company/tethix">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;every Friday to inspire a bit of positive action and
  help you explore new paths in your practice. Each seed is a tiny challenge that hones your elemental ethics skills and
  expands your possibility space. We invite you to share these seeds generously with your network.</p>
<p>Here are the seeds we planted in the previous lunation cycle:</p>
<p>üå±&nbsp;<em>Meet a friend or colleague you haven‚Äôt spoken with in a while for coffee and discuss how generative AI
    might change the way you work. Share your thoughts on LinkedIn.</em>&nbsp;(<a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7123435660639649793">More context</a>.)</p>
<p>üå±&nbsp;<em>Send a message of gratitude to somebody who's relentlessly bringing up important issues others prefer to
    ignore. Let them know you appreciate their perseverance, and tell them how they‚Äôve inspired you to think or act
    differently.</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7125957245166583808/">More
    context</a>.)</p>
<p>üå±&nbsp;<em>Think about how you might contribute to a more responsible AI future. Write and share an action-oriented
    Responsible AI Pledge that you can meet in the next month.</em>&nbsp;(<a

<p>If you like these, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://linkedin.com/company/tethix">follow Tethix on LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;and
  hope that the algorithm brings them into your feed every Friday. (Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll share them in the Newmoonsletter
  too.)</p>
<p>And we also want to extend a warm welcome to Pathfinders who might be joining us via&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/">Substack</a>. We are now posting our long form content, the Pathfinders
  Newmoonsletter, and other pathfinding explorations on Substack to make it easier to follow our updates and engage in
  conversations. That said, we are firm believers in giving you the choice of channels and ways of subscribing, so you
  can still follow our blog and Substack publication via RSS. But hey, if you enjoy Substack, you can now subscribe
  to&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.substack.com/">Tethix Pathfinding</a>&nbsp;and help us spread these seeds through your
  network.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you‚Äôre reading these words, we‚Äôre glad to have you here, Pathfinder, and we thank you for the
  gift of time. There is yet hope for better tech futures if we take the time to share stories and seeds of inspiration.
</p>
<h3>A special invitation to Full Moon Pathfinding</h3>
<p>Speaking of sharing stories, we have just one more seed to plant. A special invitation to a üåï Full Moon Pathfinding
  session on Nov 27 at 7PM AEDT / 9AM CET (<a
    href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Tethix+Full+Moon+Pathfinding&amp;iso=20231127T19&amp;p1=240">check
    your timezone</a>), when the moon will once again be illuminated by the sun. We‚Äôll yarn about AI golems, climate
  doom, seeds of hope, and anything else you choose to bring with you.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôd like an invitation, reply to this email (<a
    href="mailto:community@tethix.co">community@tethix.co</a>&nbsp;for those reading this on the web) with your own
  weather observations. How thick is the fog where you live, have you spotted any fogbows yet?</p>
<h3>Keep on finding paths on your own</h3>
<p>And if you can‚Äôt make it to our Full Moon Pathfinding session, we still invite you to make your own! If anything
  emerges while reading this Newmoonsletter, write it down. You can keep these reflections for yourself or share them
  with others. If it feels right, find the Reply button ‚Äì or comment on this post ‚Äì and share your reflections with us.
  We‚Äôd love to feature Pathfinders reflections in upcoming Newmoonsletters and explore even more diverse perspectives.
</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôve enjoyed this Newmoonsletter or perhaps even cracked a smile, we‚Äôd appreciate it if you shared it with
  your friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>The next Newmoonsletter will rise again during the next new moon. Stay safe in the AI-generated fog out there until
  then, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell. There‚Äôs magic in both.</p>
