title: Pathfinders Newmoonsletter, December 2023
date: 2023-12-13
description: >
  Make it more absurd: more drama, more AI, more smoke and mirrors. As the new moon rises, we attempt to counter the absurdity and drama with elephants, rainbow mirrors, and sparks for conversations.
---

<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>With this Newmoonsletter, crafted around the Tethix campfire, we invite you to join other Pathfinders as we reflect
  on celestial movements in tech in the previous lunar cycle, water our ETHOS Gardens, and plant seeds of intentions for
  the new cycle that begins today.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Weather Report</strong></h2>
<p>⛈️&nbsp;<strong>Current conditions: storms gathering in the West.</strong></p>
<p>As streaming services increase their subscription prices, we got to enjoy a free Succession-inspired drama courtesy
  of OpenAI. A year after they unleashed their AI golems onto the world, it's looking stormy in the land of AI golems.
  We wanted to reassure our readers that all the billionaires are safe and sound, underground bunkers intact.
  Incidentally, the drama has intensified the fog and the storms helped to hide other misdeeds from your feeds.</p>
<p>So, instead of speculating about the squabbles between fire apprentices, we wanted to bring your attention to Meta's
  continued dedication to prioritizing business goals over the well-being of people, Spotify wrapping the year not just
  with fun music-listening stats but with more layoffs – much harder on regular tech workers than well-connected CEOs –,
  OpenAI's AI golems living to the name of their creators and being generously open about secrets they were supposed to
  protect, and inspiring examples of collective organising on TikTok, of all places.&nbsp;<em>(See:<a
      href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/tech/meta-facebook-instagram-teen-safety/index.html">&nbsp;Mark
      Zuckerberg personally rejected Meta’s proposals to improve teen mental health</a>, <a

      concerns</a>)</em></p>
<p>But fear not, the AI golems are in no danger of being recalled – despite some reports of nightshade poisoning–, and
  the new OpenAI board of 100% all white men will work hard to ensure alignment to their worldview, and to make a
  proclamation when they achieve AGI. White smoke rises from the OpenAI chimney, everyone, carbon footprint be
  damned!&nbsp;<em>(See:<a

      an image with generative AI uses as much energy as charging your phone</a>)</em></p>
<p>Speaking of smoke and mirrors, it appears that AI golems are now also being used to generate non-existing female
  speakers at gatherings of fire practitioners. The New York Times also proved their journalistic excellence by omitting
  women from their list of 12 AI&nbsp;<s>apostles</s>&nbsp;pioneers. We have been reporting for a while that the AI fog
  is thickening, but the fog isn't making women any more invisible than men if you keep your eyes open.&nbsp;<em>(See:<a

  points. Share them far and wide to help dissipate some of the fog, as we collectively take a deep breath and prepare
  for a new year of uncertain weather conditions.</p>
<p>Hug somebody you love, laugh at the absurdity of the world, and when you're ready, join us for the final selection of
  seeds and sparks in Earth’s almost completed revolution around the Sun.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Elemental seeds</strong></h2>
<h3 class="fire">Fire seeds to stoke your Practice</h3>
<a href="https://tethix.co/workshops/exploring-the-gen-ai-fire/"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/workshop-exploring-the-gen-ai-fire-elements.png" alt="An illustration of people worshipping a raging wildfire"></a>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/ai-at-work-research/">Salesforce survey</a>&nbsp;shows that
  over half of workers who are using generative AI at work are doing so without formal approval, and a whooping 79%
  don't have clearly defined gen AI policies at work. Hello, <a
    href="https://www.techpolicy.press/beware-the-emergence-of-shadow-ai/">shadow AI</a>!</p>
<p>Ignoring the AI elephant in the room is not going to make it disappear just because you don't want or know how to
  deal with it. The same applies to all ethical tensions and dilemmas: just because you intend to have a well-behaved
  elephant in your office, it doesn't mean you're not going to have to clean some elephant poop in the morning if you do
  not potty-train your elephant. Good intent is just the beginning, acting on it is much harder.</p>
<p>Fear not, we do not step into elephant poop when discussing the intent to action gap with the wonderful host Debra J
  Farber in a recent&nbsp;<a
    href="https://shiftingprivacyleft.buzzsprout.com/2059470/13890617-s2e35-embed-ethics-into-your-sdlc-from-reactive-firefighting-to-responsible-firekeeping-with-mathew-mytka-alja-isakovic-tethix">episode</a>&nbsp;of
  her Shifting Privacy Left Podcast. But you will learn more about the intent to action gap, Elemental Ethics, how our
  ETHOS platform will help you embed and embody ethics in your organisation, and more.</p>
<p>(And hopefully, you'll forgive us for misusing the elephant metaphor to get your attention. We know we're all a bit
  overwhelmed and stressed at this time of the year, so why not throw some metaphorical elephant poop around to release
  some tension, eh?)</p>
<p>Responsible product development isn't just about taming AI elephants, though. This year, <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2023/introducing-web-sustainability-guidelines/">The World Wide Web
    Consortium</a>&nbsp;(W3C) released the first draft of <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/">Web Sustainability
    Guidelines</a>&nbsp;that offer guidance on “how to design and implement digital products and services that put
  people and the planet first”. If you've ever visited any W3C guidelines, you know they can be a lot to process, but
  it's important stuff. Luckily, Sustainable Web Design now offers a more <a
    href="https://sustainablewebdesign.org/guidelines/">easily digestible website</a>, where you can browse the
  guidelines by categories and tags. Bookmark it, share it with your team, and use it generously to spark discussions
  and more sustainable practices!</p>
<h3 class="air">Air seeds to improve the flow of Collaboration</h3>
<a href="https://tethix.co/air/we-looked-into-a-rainbow-mirror-to-explore-a-preferable-ai-powered-future-and-found-love/"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mythopoetic_Sense-Making_of_our_AI_Future_AI_month_event.png" alt=""></a>
<p>Having conversations might not seem like much in an industry that values productivity and output. But as Australia's
  AI Month comes to a close this week, we had many opportunities to rediscover just how important it is to sit around
  the campfire – digital or physical – together and talk. Whether it's by telling stories or exploring diverse
  perspectives, conversations are how we make sense of the world together.</p>
<p>We started our AI Month with mythopoetic sense-making of our AI future, an event we hosted in partnership with RSA
  Oceania and Co-Labs. We told the story of <a
    href="https://tethix.co/earth/tethix-storytime-fire-stories-and-ai-golems/">Fire stories and AI golems</a>&nbsp;and
  used the <a href="https://tethix.co/earth/introducing-the-taxonomy-of-tethix-mirrors/">Taxonomy of Tethix
    Mirrors</a>&nbsp;to find … love. You can read more about how we got there in our post-event reflection <a
    href="https://tethix.co/air/we-looked-into-a-rainbow-mirror-to-explore-a-preferable-ai-powered-future-and-found-love/">We
    looked into a Rainbow Mirror to explore a preferable AI-powered future and found love</a>.</p>
<p>We joined forces and spirits again with RSA Oceania for the event AI and Collective Futurecrafting, a
  thought-provoking conversation on the role AI might play in collectively crafting preferable futures. We again circled
  love in that conversation, but also wanted to highlight the <a href="https://www.indigenous-ai.net/">Abundant
    Intelligences project</a>&nbsp;that aims to engage Indigenous communities in the design and development of AI models
  that are more inclusive.</p>
<p>And today, as the Newmoonsletter rises, we're partnering with the Salesforce’s strategic innovation team, <a
    href="https://www.salesforce.com/ignite/">Ignite</a>, in Gadigal, Sydney, for the event <a
    href="https://events.humanitix.com/igniting-a-humane-ai-business-culture">Igniting a Humane AI Business Culture</a>.
  Instead of the usual panel-of-experts-talking-at-people, we designed a three-part elemental ethics adventure designed
  to spark conversations. You'll find some sparks from the event at the end of the Newmoonsletter if you're looking for
  some conversation starters for your holiday office party or family gathering.</p>
<p>In the past moons, we had the honour of participating in several other gatherings and conversations. The&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.purposeconference.co/">Purpose Conference</a>&nbsp;in Sydney last month was a standout. Hundreds
  of purpose-driven folks gathered to learn together about regenerative systems, responsible tech, and more. We
  appreciated the emphasis on the power of imagination, the importance of regenerative practices, and the value of deep
  listening to the ancient wisdom encoded in stories from the oldest living culture of Australia’s Indigenous people. We
  can't wait to return next year.</p>
<p>We also embraced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.activehope.info/project-active-hope">Active Hope</a>&nbsp;present at
  the&nbsp;<a href="https://adaptnsw2023forum.com.au/">AdaptNSW Forum</a>&nbsp;held by the Office of Energy and Climate
  Change. Hope is definitely sustained by knowing that you’re not alone in trying to change how things are done. At the
  event, we were inspired by the many passionate people persistently working to help people, communities, businesses,
  and the living systems around us and within us to adapt to climate change and our metacrises. A good reminder that
  while some of our crises might seem unsurmountable, we can nurture and share a love for life, have a laugh at the
  absurdity of it all, and together continue having conversations and taking actions that lead towards the future we
  hope for.</p>
<p>And on our blog, you can now read Mat’s reflection&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.co/water/whats-in-the-ai-leadership-secret-sauce/">What’s in the AI Leadership Secret
    Sauce?</a>, prompted by the conversations he had at Australia’s&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.ceda.com.au/2023-AI-Leadership-Summit">AI Leadership Summit 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Having conversations and developing a common language is becoming especially important as social places on the
  internet undergo further fragmentation, a trend wonderfully explored in the essay <a
    href="https://folklore.mirror.xyz/YBIKcVZkEi-KiL836LK40O6ZBC1yaSt0-yuUkPvdMgo">The Balkanization &amp;
    Babelification of the Internet</a>.</p>
<h3 class="earth">Earth seeds to ground you in Research</h3>
<a href="https://tethix.co/earth/forget-a16z-this-is-why-we-should-all-be-techne-optimists/"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rainbow-mirrors.png" alt=""></a>
<p>We talk a lot about the challenges we see in tech, but deep down we are still techne-optimists. No, no, not the
  pedal-to-the-metal-don't-stop-for-pedestrians kind. We let Nate explain our philosophy in the essay <a
    href="https://tethix.co/earth/forget-a16z-this-is-why-we-should-all-be-techne-optimists/">Forget a16z, this is why
    we should all be techne-optimists</a>. It's a lengthy one, but you’re already pushing meetings into the new year, so
  it's a good one to pass the final days before you clock out for the year.</p>
<p>Unlike a16z, being optimistic for us doesn't mean ignoring research and the severity of social and climate issues we
  are facing as humanity. We are excited about AI, but we cannot ignore its environmental costs. We already wrote about
  how OpenAI &amp; Big Tech co. are anything but open about the costs of training and using their Large Language Models
  (LLMs), but luckily academic researchers and open-source models are filling in the gaps.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the topic, you should read the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16863">Power
    Hungry Processing: Watts Driving the Cost of AI Deployment?</a>&nbsp;– or the more easily digestible Technology
  Review write up <a
    href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/01/1084189/making-an-image-with-generative-ai-uses-as-much-energy-as-charging-your-phone/">Making
    an image with generative AI uses as much energy as charging your phone</a>. We're now seeing companies using LLMs
  for use cases where simpler – and less power hungry – machine learning models might suffice, simply because LLMs are
  all the rage.</p>
<p>We think it's important to be aware of the carbon costs in product development – or your own usage – when deciding
  whether and how to deploy AI models. So let this be your friendly reminder that open-source models with greater
  transparency exist (see <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/fmti/">The Foundation Model Transparency Index</a>&nbsp;or
  <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/Carbon-Compare">Hugging Face Carbon Compare Tool</a>&nbsp;to
  explore alternatives) and that there’s a world of AI models besides LLMs out there already in production and making
  biased choices.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen it already, we again recommend the TEDTalk <a
    href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sasha_luccioni_ai_is_dangerous_but_not_for_the_reasons_you_think">AI is dangerous,
    but not for the reasons you think</a>&nbsp;by the Power Hungry Processing paper's lead author Sasha Luccioni.</p>
<p>And as entertaining as the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/make-it-more-ai-trend">Make It More AI
    trend</a>&nbsp;is, it is worth questioning whether we can actually afford the costs of AI image generation. Before
  this year's UN Climate Summit COP28, the UN released their <a
    href="https://www.unep.org/interactives/emissions-gap-report/2023/">2023 Emissions Gap Report</a>&nbsp;titled
  “Broken Record: Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions (again)”. Oof. So, remember to feed your
  human designers and use AI generators wisely!</p>
<p>Sadly, yet again, COP28 made the AI dilemma appear smaller. This year's UN climate extravaganza took place in an
  oil-rich human-rights-poor country, to which most of the 80,000 attendees had to fly to, with hundreds still choosing
  the convenience and exorbitant carbon emissions of&nbsp;<a
    href="https://theconversation.com/why-are-people-still-flying-to-climate-conferences-by-private-jet-218459">private
    jets</a>&nbsp;to enjoy beef burgers and a session on&nbsp;<a
    href="https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/12/06/un-climate-summit-includes-session-on-responsible-yachting/">sustainable
    yachting</a>. Some countries again pledged to be less naughty by 2050 in hopes to impress Santa, but we’ll
  collectively leave the phasing out of fossil fuels to our (grand)children, should they reach adulthood. But hey, at
  least the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cop28.com/en/">COP28 website</a>&nbsp;offers you the not-default option of a
  low-carbon version!</p>
<p>If you’re like us, stuff like this makes you want to scream. And please do scream, releasing anger is healthy! But
  when you scream your lungs out, join us back in the good fight. We often have to remind ourselves that we are
  optimists – that’s why we had Nate write that whole&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.co/earth/forget-a16z-this-is-why-we-should-all-be-techne-optimists/">lengthy essay</a>&nbsp;on
  it – and that despite all the poop-throwing we do as a species, we still all deserve a chance to live a healthy and
  dignified life, within biophysical limits. And no, this doesn’t mean living in caves (unless you enjoy the comforts of
  cave-living). Which is why the choices we make as technologists still matter. The criteria we use for choosing AI
  systems matter. Product decisions matter. We have the power to design and build software more responsibility – perhaps
  with low-carbon as the default –, and technology will certainly be a part of how we deal with climate change.</p>
<p>So, if you're interested in machine learning, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/">Climate
    Change AI</a>, a non-profit exploring the intersection of climate change and machine learning. At the same time,
  it's worth reiterating that carbon emissions are far from our only problem and that we need systems change, not just
  climate change, as the Wellbeing Economy Alliance <a href="https://weall.org/systemschange">reminds us</a>. We know we
  share a lot of links to resources that take time to read, so if you're in a hurry, just watch their <a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7130498850007445505/">short explainer video on
    LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;and hit that Repost button*.</p>
<p>(*And if you happen to be on LinkedIn, why not give <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tethix/">our
    page</a>&nbsp;a follow and show our posts some love to help us spread our seeds and sparks? Yeah, we know, we hate
  feeding the algorithm too, but we're really trying to bring something different into people's feeds.)</p>
<h3 class="water">Water seeds to deepen your Reflection</h3>
<a href="https://tethix.co/water/discovering-stories-about-digital-workplaces-like-slack-that-can-cultivate-a-culture-of-collective-wisdom-and-care/"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/feature-img_workplace-stories.png" alt="Illustration of four people sitting around a campfire, each person with a place influencing their thoughts.

<p>Huh, grounding in research certainly is not for the faint of heart, we can almost understand why the folks at a16z
  don't bother with it. Almost! But the good news is that you’ve reached the part of the Newmoonsletter where we try to
  inspire awe and hope.</p>
<p>So let's begin with deepfakes. Wait, what? Hold on, maybe they are not the epistemic apocalypse we imagine them to
  be! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG8xGU2HN7o">Watch</a>&nbsp;philosopher Joshua Habgood-Coote argue that
  deepfakes are not a new invention and how we might be able to deal with them as a society. (If you enjoy reading
  philosophy papers, you can also dig into his arguments in <a
    href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-023-04097-3">paper format</a>.)</p>
<p>This year, AI has certainly sparked and popularized interesting discussions about what it means to be human,
  sprinkling terminology from different fields all over the place. You might have heard that “hallucinate” was <a
    href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/15/hallucinate-cambridge-dictionary-word-of-the-year">chosen as
    Cambridge dictionary’s word of the year</a>. An intriguing coincidence at a time when <a
    href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/funding-for-research-on-psychedelics-is-on-the-rise-along-with-scientists-hopes-for-using-them/">funding
    for research on psychedelics is on the rise</a>. What if we are all, machines and humans, just hallucinating? Should
  we hallucinate more to get to the more profound questions? Will we invent machine psychedelics next? We leave these
  deep reflections to you, dear reader.</p>
<p>You might have also come across <a
    href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/white-ai-faces-more-convincing">research</a>&nbsp;suggesting that we are already
  struggling with telling AI-generated faces from real ones. But a <a
    href="https://theconversation.com/ai-generated-faces-look-just-like-real-ones-but-evidence-shows-your-brain-can-tell-the-difference-216465">recent
    study from Australia</a>&nbsp;that used EEG caps, showed that our brains might subconsciously perceive the
  difference, so maybe there's hope for humanity yet.</p>
<p>Let this be a reminder that we don't yet fully understand human intelligence, let alone the intelligence of other
  living beings. For instance, coming back full circle to elephants, <a
    href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/elephants/elephants-give-each-other-names-the-1st-non-human-animals-to-do-so-study-claims">recent
    research</a>&nbsp;seems to indicate that elephants give each other names! A fascinating use of technology to help us
  understand non-human languages and appreciate diverse forms of intelligence.</p>
<p>If thinking about elephant names isn't enough to make you appreciate life, we recommend playing the <a
    href="https://kottke.org/23/11/a-45-billion-year-video-timeline-of-earth-in-60-minutes">4.5 Billion Year Video
    Timeline of Earth in 60 Minutes</a>&nbsp;by Kurzgesagt in the background. Or if you want to feel even smaller as you
  ponder your place in the Universe – the end of the year is a good time for that, regardless whether you're warming
  your hands with hot ginger tea with honey like Alja in Europe, or melting in early Aussie heat waves like Mat and Nate
  – watch this incredible&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA">timelapse of the future</a>.</p>
<p>Whoa. That's a lot to take in, isn't it? For us, it's a reminder to appreciate life and the time we have on Earth
  with each other. And to continue spreading seeds and sparks that will make our Earth adventure better for more people,
  elephants, and other beings.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Moonthly Meme</strong></h2>
<p>Given that we didn’t fly to COP28 (or anywhere else) in a private jet, we allowed ourselves the luxury of asking
  ChatGPT to generate an image to interpret this Newmoonsletter. And we got this adorable image of the AI elephant you
  left sitting alone in your empty office building, looking like they might indeed benefit from knowing where the
  bathroom is.</p>
<img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/AI_elephant_sitting_in_your_office-by_ChatGPT.jpg" alt="AI-generated image of a grey elephant sitting alone in an open-space office">
<p>Then we asked ChatGPT to make it more…&nbsp;je ne sais quoi.</p>
<img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/AI_elephant_sitting_in_your_office_but_more-by_ChatGPT.jpg" alt="AI-generated image of an elephant sitting alone in a futuristic looking office full of tech and floating plants">
<p>And it appears that your AI elephant is the only one that survives the apocalypse. Or perhaps the elephant was
  promoted to CEO, finally allowed everyone to work remotely, and turned the expensive office building into a hydroponic
  garden from which they now run operations using a quantum computer.</p>
<p>Either way, even the AI elephant knows there’s power in nature and that offices aren’t the natural habitat for
  humans, so we hope you manage to stay out of the office as much as you can in the next lunation cycle. And when you
  come back, don’t forget to feed and potty-train any elephants you might find in your office.</p>
<h2><strong>Your turn, Pathfinders.</strong></h2>
<h3>Moonthly Pathfinding Seeds to plant &amp; Elemental Sparks to share</h3>
<p>This moon, we planted new Pathfinding Seeds on&nbsp;<a
    href="https://linkedin.com/company/tethix">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;to inspire a bit of positive action and help you
  explore new paths in your practice. We invite you to share these seeds generously with your network.</p>
<p>Here are the seeds we planted in the previous lunation cycle:</p>
<p>🌱&nbsp;<em>Explore the deeper narratives and ancient wisdom in Theft of Fire myths and contemplate the relevance to
    tech in our current world. Then do some reflection on the parallels we see today and your role in the
    story.&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7131059806345297920">More
    context</a>.)</p>
<p>🌱&nbsp;<em>Harness the power of expanding your knowledge around tech ethics instead of buying material things.
    Reflect on your learnings and share insights gained with people around you.&nbsp;</em>(<a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7133681772113924096">More context</a>.)</p>
<p>As we were preparing for today’s special event, we decided to bring some joy and spark discussions with Elemental
  Sparks. We hope you can use these sparks to bridge divisions, spark discussions and storytelling, and deepen your
  relationships.</p>
<p>✨&nbsp;<strong>Learning.&nbsp;</strong>What are machines learning from us? What are we learning about ourselves from
  them?&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7136119206860783617">More context</a>.)</p>
<p>✨&nbsp;<strong>Ignite.</strong>&nbsp;What ignites your imagination? What ignites innovation? What ignites culture
  change? (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7138655920917512192">More context</a>.)</p>
<p>For the event, we designed Paper Elemental Sparks in the shape of origami fortune-tellers you might remember playing
  with as a kid. Instead of telling fortunes, Paper Elemental Sparks can be used as a conversation starter (and an
  excellent fidget toy!). Regardless of whether you’ll be joining us at the event, you can&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.co/paper-sparks/">print the paper sparks</a>&nbsp;– or blank templates! – and use them at the
  office party or any other gathering, perhaps even as a tree ornament or a distraction for the kids.</p>

<p>If the sparks bring you joy or spark interesting discussions, we’d love to hear from you!</p>
<h3>Join us for Full Moon Pathfinding</h3>
<p>Speaking of sharing, we are again inviting you to a 🌕 Full Moon Pathfinding session on Dec 27 at 7PM AEDT / 9AM CET
  (<a
    href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Tethix+Full+Moon+Pathfinding&amp;iso=20231227T19&amp;p1=240">check
    your timezone</a>), when the moon will once again be illuminated by the sun. We’ll yarn about elephants, rainbow
  mirrors, our hopes and wishes for the new year, and anything else you choose to bring with you.</p>
<p>If you’d like an invitation, reply to this email (<a
    href="mailto:community@tethix.co">community@tethix.co</a>&nbsp;for those reading this on the web) with your own
  weather observations. Have you felt the storms where you live, how thick is the fog you’ve observed?</p>
<h3>Keep on finding paths on your own</h3>
<p>And if you can’t make it to our Full Moon Pathfinding session, we still invite you to make your own! If anything
  emerges while reading this Newmoonsletter, write it down. You can keep these reflections for yourself or share them
  with others. If it feels right, find the Reply button – or comment on this post – and share your reflections with us.
  We’d love to feature Pathfinders reflections in upcoming Newmoonsletters and explore even more diverse perspectives.
</p>
<p>And if you’ve enjoyed this Newmoonsletter or perhaps even cracked a smile, we’d appreciate it if you shared it with
  your friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>The next Newmoonsletter will rise again during the next new moon. Stay safe in the AI-generated fog out there until
  then, try to learn the names of any elephants you encounter, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and
  the stories you tell. There’s magic in both.</p>
<p>And finally, remember to smile and love generously as we approach another solstice and prepare for another roundtrip
  around the Sun together.</p>
<p>With 🙂 from the Tethix campfire,<br>Alja, Mat, Nate</p>
