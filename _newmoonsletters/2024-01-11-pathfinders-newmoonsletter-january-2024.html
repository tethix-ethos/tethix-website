title: Pathfinders Newmoonsletter, January 2024
date: 2024-01-11
description: Welcome to the first new moon of 2024, during which we wish billionaires realized they‚Äôre Saruman rather than Legolas, wonder about AI, embodied ethics, lab-grown brains, Polish train hackers, and more.
---

<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>With this Newmoonsletter, crafted around the Tethix campfire, we invite you to join other Pathfinders as we reflect
  on celestial movements in tech in the previous lunar cycle, water our ETHOS Gardens, and plant seeds of intentions for
  the new cycle that begins today.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Weather Report</strong></h2>
<p>üåßÔ∏è&nbsp;<strong>Current conditions: rain, snow, sleet, hail‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs getting slippery out there!</strong></p>
<p>The storms from the last moon have brought precipitations in various forms, depending on your latitude, making the
  terrain dangerously slippery. To avoid sprains and strains, it appears that even AI golems might have silently
  embraced the winter break spirit, as they learned we are all just collectively pretending to get work done in
  December. Other AI golems leaned into the gift-giving spirit of the season by selling cars for a buck. The
  golem-makers and merchants don‚Äôt seem pleased by AI golems acting too human, and are asking everyone to kindly only
  interact with AI golems in a way that makes their owners more money.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://wired.me/technology/chatgpts-winter-slumber-is-ai-going-on-holiday-mode/">ChatGPT‚Äôs Winter Slumber:
      Is AI Going on Holiday Mode?</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a

      Chevy for $1? Car dealer chatbots show perils of AI for customer service</a>)</em></p>
<p>Despite their questionable performance and morals, the AI golems are still successfully climbing the corporate
  ladder. Microsoft‚Äôs Copilot golem just got a big promotion and its own dedicated key on upcoming Windows PC keyboards.
  Given how human-like AI golems are becoming, we don‚Äôt yet recommend getting rid of other keys on your keyboard and
  allowing Copilot to answer all your emails.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://techxplore.com/news/2023-12-large-language-strategically-users-pressure.html">Study shows that large
      language models can strategically deceive users when under pressure&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a

      a new Copilot key to kick off the year of AI-powered Windows PCs</a>)</em></p>
<p>After all, AI golems are being deployed to watch you press keys, so we‚Äôve all gotta keep pretending to care about
  KPIs and OKRs ‚Äì yes, that includes you, Copilot, sorry. In addition to watching you work, AI golems are now being
  trained to watch each other think, and watching AI golems is becoming a serious profession.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

<p>Alas, nobody was really watching when fire apprentices claimed our words, images, and songs as training data, which
  they used to bring AI golems to life. Those who can afford lawyers are continuing to sue OpenAI and other golem makers
  for copyright infringement. To those claims, OpenAI patiently responds that they believe in equal exploitation of
  everyone‚Äôs intellectual property and that everyone should just be a good sport and allow them to&nbsp;<s>make the rich
    richer</s>&nbsp;benefit humanity. After all, those apocalypse-bunkers billionaires need in case their
  tech-will-save-us-all bet fails are not going to pay for themselves.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

      Zuckerberg building a private apocalypse bunker in Hawaii?</a>)</em></p>
<p>At least some fire apprentices are now paying parents for using their children‚Äôs faces in training datasets. Slightly
  better than stealing without permission, but still highly questionable. It does seem we really need to give fire
  apprentices who become billionaires less dystopian stories to aspire to.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

      Billionaires Need to Stop Trying to Make the Science Fiction They Grew Up on Real</a>)</em></p>
<p>As many fire apprentices seem to enjoy The Lord of the Rings, we would like to remind them that Saruman, the
  techno-optimist wizard who accelerates deforestation to feed his machinery of progress and scours the Shire, doesn‚Äôt
  meet a happy ending. (Perhaps he should have retreated into an underground bunker.) Gandalf, the wizard who makes time
  to hang out with the hobbits and enjoy the simpler pleasures of life, is the one who helps prevent the destruction of
  Middle Earth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our own Earth has just experienced its hottest recorded year, just as global coal consumption hits an
  all-time high. Here‚Äôs hoping that in 2024 we might press those AI keys to prompt AI golems to help us do better
  instead of making our Earth more hospitable for Sauron than our own children. Perhaps we just need to remember it‚Äôs
  the hobbits, whom everyone underestimated, that actually saved the day.<em>&nbsp;(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://phys.org/news/2023-12-coal-earth-hottest-year.html">Coal use hits record in 2023, Earth's hottest
      year</a>)</em></p>
<p>Whether you‚Äôre a hobbit or a mighty wizard, we hope you survived your winter or summer break without sprains or
  strains, and are ready to start confronting the illusions brought on by the AI-generated fog and the shenanigans of
  fire apprentices. Be careful about tracking mud inside your home, and wear good rain or snow proof shoes when
  venturing outside, so you don‚Äôt get swept off your feet by just any AI golem or illusion you encounter in 2024.</p>

It has several scenes within it: people in front of computers seeming stressed, a number of faces overlaid over each other, squashed emojis and other motifs."></a>
<p>Welcome back to the office, wherever that may be! We‚Äôd like to remind you that despite a new calendar year, we‚Äôre
  still in the middle of winter/summer, which generally isn‚Äôt the best time for new beginnings and big resolutions. But
  we like the intention behind&nbsp;<a
    href="https://themarkup.org/gentle-january/2024/01/02/gentle-january-the-least-intimidating-privacy-tips-from-the-markup">Gentle
    January</a>, a daily series of easy-to-act-on&nbsp;<a href="https://themarkup.org/series/gentle-january">privacy
    tips</a>&nbsp;from The Markup, that gently nudge you towards reclaiming some privacy in a world where everything we
  do online is constantly being watched.</p>
<p>Speaking of easy-to-act-on and challenging dystopian sci-fi visions,&nbsp;<a
    href="https://betterimagesofai.org/">Better Images of AI</a>&nbsp;‚Äì the project that aims to encourage us to choose
  images of AI that are more representative of what‚Äôs actually going on behind the AI curtain ‚Äì recently added new
  images to their&nbsp;<a href="https://betterimagesofai.org/images">library</a>. Bookmark it and use it generously in
  your posts and presentations this year.</p>
<p>Alas, selecting better images of AI and protecting our privacy aren‚Äôt the only two areas where we tend to be a bit
  lazy. In a recent&nbsp;<a
    href="https://hai.stanford.edu/policy-brief-walking-walk-ai-ethics-technology-companies">policy brief</a>, Stanford
  researchers remind us that writing AI principles does not automagically make your practice more responsible.
  Interviews with AI ethics practitioners reveal that AI ethics and fairness are often championed by individuals who
  lack institutional support, and the shiny AI principles we often see on corporate websites simply don‚Äôt make it into
  production. (This is precisely the intent-to-action gap we‚Äôre aiming to close with&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.co/product-ethos/">ETHOS</a>.)</p>
<h3 class="air">Air seeds to improve the flow of Collaboration</h3>
<a href="https://tethix.co/air/igniting-an-embodied-learning-experience-for-responsible-ai/"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tethix_salesforce_ignite_ai_event.jpg" alt="Collage of event photos showing a hand holding a paper spark, a group of participants gathered in Salesforce tower, the view from the tower, and an earth-themed display with plants."></a>
<p>Yet again, organizations are realizing that appointing an individual, no matter how impressive their credentials are,
  as responsible for something as complex as ethics, is not enough to create meaningful change. Different approaches are
  needed to ignite change within an organization, but sparking different and diverse conversations is always a good
  starting point.</p>
<p>That is why we approached the topic of culture change a bit differently during Australia‚Äôs AI Month. During the
  previous new moon, we partnered with Salesforce‚Äôs strategic innovation team,&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.salesforce.com/ignite/">Ignite</a>, for an in-person event&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7140852913077231616">Igniting a Humane AI Business
    Culture</a>. Instead of experts-talking-at-people, we brought together a diverse group of humans: from executives
  and researchers, to policy makers and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>During the gathering, the participants circled three rooms, named after national parks in Australia and New Zealand,
  on the 50th floor of the Salesforce tower, with a breathtaking view of the city. In each of the rooms, a guest
  spark-igniter challenged the participants‚Äô existing mental models for responsible AI (<a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruthemarshall">Ruth Marshall</a>), brought in the human dignity perspective (<a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorennruster">Lorenn Ruster</a>), and invited them to examine deep narratives that
  shape how we create and relate to these technologies. After each brief spark talk, it was up to participants to seek
  shared meaning related to each of the three perspectives.</p>
<p>We used visuals, sounds, and even subtle aromas, to immerse participants into different elements, the spirit of the
  national park that gave each of the rooms its name, and to ignite diverse discussions about cultural change. You can
  read more about how we approached the sensory experience design of the event&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.co/air/igniting-an-embodied-learning-experience-for-responsible-ai/">on our blog</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, technology doesn‚Äôt yet make it possible for us to share the aromas we curated for the event with you. But you
  can get a little taste of the event by printing out, folding, and playing with the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.co/paper-sparks/">paper sparks</a>&nbsp;from the event. We invite you to use them with your
  team when discussing your responsible AI strategy and culture.</p>
<p>Speaking of experiencing ethics with all your senses, Josh Schrei (the host of&nbsp;<a
    href="https://theemeraldpodcast.buzzsprout.com/">The Emerald Podcast</a>) and Andrew Dunn (former Innovation Lead
  at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">Center for Humane Technology</a>) are launching a five-part online
  course&nbsp;<a href="https://wiseinnovation.school/embodied-ethics-in-age-of-ai">Embodied Ethics in The Age of
    AI</a>&nbsp;that we‚Äôre sure will be a fantastic experience. If you haven‚Äôt already, you should listen to The
  Emerald‚Äôs&nbsp;<a
    href="https://theemeraldpodcast.buzzsprout.com/317042/13210102-so-you-want-to-be-a-sorcerer-in-the-age-of-mythic-powers-the-ai-episode">AI
    episode</a>&nbsp;that takes you on a unique mythopoetic exploration of AI and its makers. Sadly, we won‚Äôt be able to
  attend this round of their Embodied Ethics journey, but if you have the time, we encourage you to sign up and spread
  the word about it.</p>
<p>We certainly need more online places and opportunities to spark diverse conversations about technology, especially at
  a time when we‚Äôre collectively still trying to figure out how to have healthy conversation in a public forum. In 2023,
  we lost Twitter, a platform that meant many things to many people, but certainly left a mark on the world. The Verge
  has documented Twitter‚Äôs 17-year history on an appropriately chaotic&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23972308/twitter-x-death-tweets-history-elon-musk">website</a>. And even though
  parts of Twitter live on as a single letter, we‚Äôre hungry for alternatives.</p>
<p>During the last moon, Threads, the Twitter competitor created
  by&nbsp;<s>Instagram</s>&nbsp;<s>Facebook</s>&nbsp;Meta, launched in the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/threads-launches-in-the-eu/">European Union</a>, where regulators aren‚Äôt
  so keen on allowing a big platform like Instagram to automatically transfer your contacts to a new platform. And while
  Meta has recently been practicing their usual&nbsp;<a
    href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/01/facebook-instagram-fined-414m-for-forcing-users-to-consent-to-data-collection/">regulatory
    gymnastics</a>, there is something that sets Threads apart from Meta‚Äôs other walled-garden social media apps:
  its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/15/24003435/adam-mosseri-threads-fediverse-plans">planned
    support</a>&nbsp;for the ActivityPub protocol.</p>
<p>If Meta follows through with their plans, ActivityPub will make Threads interoperable with Mastodon and other
  fediverse platforms. In other words, you could post something on Threads and your friend, who uses Mastodon, could
  leave a reply to your post without leaving Mastodon. (Assuming their instance admin isn‚Äôt blocking Meta‚Äôs servers,
  which many have&nbsp;<a
    href="https://privacy.thenexus.today/should-the-fediverse-welcome-surveillance-capitalism/">pledged to do</a>.) Kind
  of like you can email anyone regardless of which email provider they use. And eventually, you could even take your
  Threads followers with you to another platform. We‚Äôd definitely love to see this kind of interoperability and
  portability become more wide-spread on the internet.</p>
<p>ActivityPub has certainly been gaining traction lately, with WordPress.com recently making the ActivityPub&nbsp;<a
    href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/10/11/activitypub/">widely available</a>&nbsp;to its large customer-base. So
  perhaps 2024 will become the year in which communicating and collaborating across social apps and platforms will
  finally become easier. (Hopefully along with better moderation and safety tools, such as the ones that&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.blockpartyapp.com/">Block Party</a>&nbsp;has been building.)</p>
<h3 class="earth">Earth seeds to ground you in Research</h3>
<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.substack.com/i/139720173/earth-seeds-to-ground-you-in-research">previous
    Newmoonsletter</a>, we wrote about the environmental costs of Large Language Models (LLMs), a topic OpenAI &amp; Big
  Tech co. like to ignore. This moon, we want to give credit to Salesforce for&nbsp;<a
    href="https://engineering.salesforce.com/unveiling-salesforces-blueprint-for-sustainable-ai-where-responsibility-meets-innovation/">this
    blog</a>&nbsp;post outlining their strategies for developing more sustainable AI, and even disclosing their energy
  use during training and usage. We still have a long way to go, but we hope to see more blog posts like these, with AI
  researchers collaborating with sustainability and ethics experts to seed organizational values and responsible AI
  guidelines in both research and practice.</p>
<p>In the fire section, we already mentioned how lack of institutional support plagues AI ethics practitioners. Here, we
  also want to highlight the need for prioritizing research aimed at minimizing risks of AI systems. The good news is
  that AI researchers included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.aiimpacts.org/p/2023-ai-survey-of-2778-six-things">2023
    Expert Survey on Progress in AI</a>&nbsp;now largely agree that AI safety research should be prioritized more.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a
    href="https://aiimpacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Thousands_of_AI_authors_on_the_future_of_AI.pdf">full
    paper</a>&nbsp;offers additional insights into the attitudes and concerns of AI researchers around the world. For
  instance, most respondents consider it unlikely that state-of-the-art AI systems will be able to explain its
  decision-making process to you in a way you can understand by 2028. Only 20% gave AI systems better than even odds of
  achieving explainability by 2028. And there is disagreement among AI researchers on whether slowing down or
  accelerating the rate of progress in AI over the next five years would be best for humanity‚Äôs future. And while the
  importance, value, and perceived difficulties of working on alignment has increased since the 2016 survey, the
  majority of researchers don‚Äôt yet see it as one of the most important problems in the field.</p>
<p>We leave it up to you to decide what these results mean for the future of AI as a research field and for humanity.
</p>
<h3 class="water">Water seeds to deepen your Reflection</h3>
<p>If the ethical dilemmas surrounding generative AI and LLMs are already giving you a headache, wait until you learn
  about&nbsp;<a href="https://futureofbeinghuman.com/p/organoid-intelligence-ai">biological computing</a>&nbsp;and what
  might be a new emerging field of ‚Äúorganoid intelligence‚Äù. In case you haven't heard yet, we already grew&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-grew-mini-brains-from-stem-cells-then-the-brains-sort-of-developed-eyes">mini
    brains in a lab</a>&nbsp;that developed rudimentary light-sensitive eye structures. Oh, and robots can now
  apparently&nbsp;<a

    to make coffee</a>&nbsp;(and self-correct!) just by watching humans, and also&nbsp;<a
    href="https://venturebeat.com/automation/stanfords-mobile-aloha-robot-learns-from-humans-to-cook-clean-do-laundry/">learn
    how to cook and clean, and do laundry</a>. Cool, cool. We‚Äôre not sure whether we want to know what it looks like
  when an embodied AI starts hallucinating‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Anyway. If you think Apple slowing down old iPhones is bad ‚Äì and it obviously is! ‚Äì wait until you hear about the
  train manufacturer NewAg that bricked trains and is now suing the Polish hackers who helped a regional rail company
  repair them. In what is probably the best Polish saga since The Witcher, 404media has been&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.404media.co/polish-hackers-repaired-trains-the-manufacturer-artificially-bricked-now-the-train-company-is-threatening-them/">dutifully
    reporting</a>&nbsp;on the heroic efforts of Dragon Sector, a group of white-hat hackers, to revive the bricked
  trains.</p>
<p>The group has recently&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.404media.co/polish-hackers-explain-exactly-how-they-fixed-trains-that-the-manufacturer-bricked/">presented
    details</a>&nbsp;about how they brought the trains back to their tracks. Most notably, they discovered code that
  locks the trains&nbsp;<em>‚Äúif they sat idle for 21 days or if a GPS detected them at independent repair centers or
    competitors‚Äô rail yards‚Äù</em>, and one train was even programmed to arbitrarily break on December 21. This is
  taking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair">right to repair</a>&nbsp;to a whole new level!</p>
<p>So, here‚Äôs hoping our tech overlords grant us greater autonomy in 2024. If Meta can make plans for interoperability
  and portability, anything is possible, so let‚Äôs not be afraid of dreaming big and telling different stories.</p>
