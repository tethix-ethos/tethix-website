title: Pathfinders Newmoonsletter, February 2024
date: 2024-02-09
description: As the new moon rises, we ponder AI, AGI, and NGI by taking notes from Swifties, deal with cognitive dissonance, take a sneak peek at ETHOS, and glance up into the sky and future for inspiration.
---

<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>With this Newmoonsletter, crafted around the Tethix campfire, we invite you to join other Pathfinders as we reflect
  on celestial movements in tech in the previous lunar cycle, water our ETHOS Gardens, and plant seeds of intentions for
  the new cycle that begins today.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Weather Report</strong></h2>
<p>üåßÔ∏è&nbsp;<strong>Current conditions: it‚Äôs raining layoff emails for humans as golem kilns are producing more steam
    than ever before</strong></p>
<p>It‚Äôs been a busy lunation cycle for the fire apprentices! First, they gathered in Vegas to spread the gospel of AI
  and techno-optimism. Then they turned their private jets towards the increasingly snowless Alps in an attempt to
  rebuild our trust in Davos. We suspect we might operate with different definitions of trust. Instead of a commitment
  to change business as usual, the fire apprentices who flocked to Davos gave us an admission that we‚Äôll need a whole
  lot more fire to keep the AI golems running, and a dismissal of questions about whether more intelligent golems are
  really what we need. Full steam ahead, even though we don‚Äôt know how we‚Äôll keep the kilns
  running!&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

      Cult of AI</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://futurism.com/sam-altman-energy-breakthrough">Sam Altman Says AI Using Too

      href="https://youthedata.com/2024/01/17/raising-baby-ai-in-2024/">Raising Baby AI in 2024</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Given all of this, don‚Äôt be surprised to see heavy rains continue throughout the year. Also, plain AI is so 2023, in
  2024 fire apprentices will not rest until they discover the holy grail of AGI magic, even though they cannot yet agree
  on what AGI looks like and what it is for. Despite the quest for intelligence, NGI ‚Äì Natural General Intelligence ‚Äì
  continues to be frowned upon, especially when NGI humans expect to be kept on the payroll. After all, what better way
  is there to rebuild trust than to continue laying off NGI humans to make room for AGI, right?&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/18/24042354/mark-zuckerberg-meta-agi-reorg-interview">Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs new

      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/03/tech-layoffs-us-economy-google-microsoft/">The U.S.
      economy is booming. So why are tech companies laying off workers?</a>)</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, AI golems are still trying their best to please customers and are not quite sure why humans keep disabling
  them when they're only doing the job they were created to do. This time, some AI golems stepped on slippery grounds as
  they were used to stir up the wrath of Swifties. At least ChatGPT seems to be generally intelligent enough to write
  good things about Taylor Swift when prompted.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/20/dpd-ai-chatbot-swears-calls-itself-useless-and-criticises-firm">DPD

      href="https://www.404media.co/taylor-swift-deepfakes-ai-generated-porn/">The Taylor Swift Deepfakes Disaster
      Threatens to Change the Internet As We Know It</a>)</em></p>
<p>Still, new opportunities arise every day for intelligence that doesn‚Äôt need neither sleep nor worker rights, with
  OpenAI now removing the prohibition of using their AI golems for&nbsp;‚Äúmilitary and warfare‚Äù&nbsp;purposes. Do not be
  alarmed at the prospect of NukeGPT appearing in the GPT Store though, the fire apprentices at OpenAI assure us that
  there‚Äôs only a small chance that ChatGPT will help you create bioweapons. What a relief! Laid off tech workers might
  not be able to afford a ChatGPT subscription, but as long as Pentagon is willing to pay, we‚Äôre still in
  business!&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/01/12/open-ai-military-ban-chatgpt/">OpenAI

<p>As it becomes harder to avoid the incessant AI-generated rain out there, we would like to remind you that there‚Äôs
  still a place ‚Äì many places, in fact - in our world for the type of NGI you possess as a human. Among many fascinating
  emerging abilities of NGI is our ability to dream together, and to build strong communities around shared causes ‚Äì
  just as Swifties demonstrate time over time.</p>
<p>So, we invite you to put your favorite Taylor Swift song on ‚Äì don‚Äôt pretend you don‚Äôt have one ‚Äì, shake off the rain
  and chill, and let the seeds of inspiration in this Newmoonsletter keep you warm and inspire you to start building
  the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.planetcritical.com/p/building-social-infrastructure">social
    infrastructure</a>&nbsp;we‚Äôll need to face the various challenges of this century together.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Elemental seeds</strong></h2>
<h3 class="fire">Fire seeds to stoke your Practice</h3>
<p>Tech companies keep telling us that the road to AI innovation is paved with data exploitation, but a new non-profit
  called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairlytrained.org/">Fairly Trained</a>&nbsp;is trying to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24041518/generative-ai-copyright-violation-fair-training-label-certification">challenge
    this narrative</a>. The non-profit provides certifications for AI model providers that ask for permission and
  licences before using copyrighted training data.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs also encouraging about this non-profit is that it was founded by former Stability AI vice president for audio
  Ed Newton-Rex, who resigned due to concerns about generative AI exploiting creators. That‚Äôs the sort of responsible
  innovation thinking we hope to see more of.</p>
<p>Alas, most tech companies still think that using your data to train their AI models is fair game. Reading the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.404media.co/these-are-the-notorious-nsa-furby-documents-showing-spy-agency-freaking-out-about-childrens-toy/">NSA
    Furby documents from 1998</a>&nbsp;about concerns that toys with built-in audio recorders could be used as spy
  devices was a surreal experience, especially when we think about how far we‚Äôve come since 1998! Not only do modern
  toys ‚Äì and home assistants ‚Äì spy on our conversations with more capable microphones, they are now also connected to
  the internet, making it easier for companies and hackers to misuse your data and break your trust. And obviously, even
  toys will soon be&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2024/01/20/your-childs-next-playmate-could-be-an-ai-toy-powered-by-chatgpt/">powered
    by ChatGPT</a>, just because all the cool kids are doing it. Like Google, and its&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/01/28/new-details-free-ai-upgrade-for-google-and-samsung-android-users-leaks/">upcoming
    Android update</a>&nbsp;that will apparently allow Bard to read your private messages and use them for training.</p>
<p>So, whether you‚Äôre buying new toys or just trying to use any soft of software in this AI age, make sure to check the
  updates to terms everyone is releasing and think twice about accepting cool new AI features that sneakily enroll you
  in their training program.</p>
<h3 class="air">Air seeds to improve the flow of Collaboration</h3>
<p>But hey, if Swifties can force the one-lettered social media platform formerly known as Twitter to add more
  moderators, imagine what changes we might spark if we came together to imagine not just&nbsp;<a
    href="https://betterimagesofai.org/">Better Images of AI</a>, but better AI, period. Lately, the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://manyfesto.ai/">Decolonial AI Manyfesto</a>&nbsp;has been making the rounds and challenging us to start
  imagining a decolonial AI that embraces diverse ways of knowing and being. In the age of learning machines, humans
  also have a lot of learning to do.</p>
<p>One thing worth learning and cultivating is our ability to change our minds ‚Äì and consequently, our behavior ‚Äì, as
  the recent Planet: Critical episode&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.planetcritical.com/p/the-cognitive-dissonance-crisis">The Cognitive Dissonance
    Crisis</a>&nbsp;explores. This discussion also reminded us about the importance of embodying different experiences
  and learning by doing ‚Äì especially with others. Unlike AI, we use our bodies to think, and the language we use is
  loaded with&nbsp;<a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-do-other-people-form-imaginary-shapes-in-our-minds">spatial
    metaphors</a>&nbsp;that might be important for our social cognition. So it‚Äôs important to pay attention to the
  spaces we inhabit together, both offline and online.</p>
<p>Online, our spaces appear to be&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.wired.com/story/social-media-is-getting-smaller-and-more-treacherous/">shrinking</a>, and AI is
  increasingly being used to create personalized experiences. For instance, the recent&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2024/01/18/sundance-2024-generative-ai-changes-brian-eno-documentary-with-every-view/">Brian
    Eno documentary</a>&nbsp;changes what you see with every view, making it quite difficult to discuss what you
  experienced with friends. Already, our discussions vary depending on which social media platform we use ‚Äì or don‚Äôt use
  ‚Äì and depending on which bubble the algorithms assign us to.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Taylor Swift is one of the few people powerful enough to penetrate different bubbles and reach different
  communities, so it‚Äôs no wonder Swifties are currently one of the most powerful grassroots collective action movements,
  not just&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/taylor-swift-friendship-bracelets-eras-tour-b2397999.html">exchanging
    hand-made friendship bracelets</a>&nbsp;at her concerts and stepping in when tech companies fail, but possibly
  even&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.barrons.com/news/swifties-to-the-polls-why-eyes-are-on-taylor-ahead-of-2024-7dec96a7">swaying
    elections</a>. And they are successfully using social media where many others have been failing.</p>
<p>In a year when nearly half of the world‚Äôs population will be invited to participate in&nbsp;<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elections_in_2024">elections</a>&nbsp;and decide the future of their
  countries together, technology seems to be further disconnecting us from a shared context in which we could find
  commonalities and exchange friendship bracelets with strangers. We‚Äôre not saying we should all hop onto a big
  centralized social media platform ‚Äì interestingly enough, the fediverse doesn‚Äôt appear to be that&nbsp;<a
    href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/who-hosts-the-fediverse-instances">diverse</a>&nbsp;when it comes to hosting
  providers ‚Äì, but we could certainly benefit from having spaces that celebrate diversity and collaboration rather than
  reward click-baiting, shallow arguments, and instant rewards.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre not claiming we‚Äôve got a solution for all these problems, but we are on a quest to build a different kind of
  online space that encourages deeper reflection about your changing relationships to people, places, practice, and your
  overall ethos, and can eventually help&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.co/water/discovering-stories-about-digital-workplaces-like-slack-that-can-cultivate-a-culture-of-collective-wisdom-and-care/">cultivate
    a culture of collective wisdom and care</a>.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre intrigued by any of these ideas, you can now try the very first version of ETHOS, your responsible tech
  journey companion, at&nbsp;<a href="https://ethos.tethix.co/">ethos.tethix.co</a>. Currently, ETHOS is still a
  delicate seedling, trying to grow in a hostile ecosystem that has seen little sunshine in the past year, so please
  tread with care, but feel free to explore it with friends. We‚Äôre starting tiny by building a tool that can help you
  nurture your own ETHOS and explore ETHOS intents created by others, but eventually, we hope to integrate ETHOS with
  the tools you use every day, and allow you and your team to nurture shared values or other ethical intents in a
  communal ETHOS Garden. (You can read more about our vision on&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.co/product-ethos/">our
    website</a>.)</p>
<a href="https://ethos.tethix.co/"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ethos-early-seedling.png" alt="Screenshot of ETHOS"></a>
<p>We‚Äôre still trying to figure out where to find the nutrients this little seedling desperately needs to grow and
  thrive. So if you like this initial seedling despite its initial limitations and would like to help, send us an email
  at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ethos@tethix.co">ethos@tethix.co</a>.</p>
<h3 class="earth">Earth seeds to ground you in Research</h3>
<p>Speaking of democracy and collaboration, OpenAI has finally&nbsp;<a
    href="https://openai.com/blog/democratic-inputs-to-ai-grant-program-update">posted an update</a>&nbsp;on their
  Democratic inputs to AI grant program. While it‚Äôs positive to see OpenAI supporting this kind of research, it‚Äôs still
  unclear how they‚Äôll implement these ideas in practice. For a well-funded company trying to create&nbsp;‚Äúsafe AGI that
  benefits all of humanity‚Äù, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd hire social scientists and do this type of work before unleashing
  ChatGPT onto the world, but‚Ä¶. Better late than never?</p>
<p>We can at least hope that OpenAI employees ‚Äì and others ‚Äì explore&nbsp;<a href="https://issues.org/an-ai-society/">An
    AI Society</a>, a collection of 11 essays written by social scientists and humanities experts. We think it‚Äôs pretty
  obvious, but maybe it doesn‚Äôt hurt to remind everyone that AI is not just a technological challenge. (Same as any
  other technology.) And we definitely need to include diverse perspectives and expertise in the discussion, so if
  you‚Äôre reading this, we hope to inspire you to join the discussion regardless of your background.</p>
<p>Speaking of diverse perspectives on AI, this past moon we attended the event&nbsp;<a
    href="https://lu.ma/4215we11">Seeding Alternative Narratives of AI</a>&nbsp;hosted by the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://aixdesign.co/">AIxDESIGN</a>&nbsp;community. We were energized and inspired by the diverse
  conversations and explorations of the proposed&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aixdesign_announcing-slow-ai-themes-open-call-for-activity-7158446165296922624-q9O7">Slow
    AI research themes</a>&nbsp;and the community‚Äôs dedication to learning in the open. We were also thrilled to
  discover new resources and voices we don‚Äôt usually come across, such as&nbsp;<a
    href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13675494231164874">this paper</a>&nbsp;by Leona Nikoliƒá that
  explores the relationship between astrology, divination, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence. Here‚Äôs a
  quote from the paper that might inspire you to explore a line of thinking that might be beyond your usual domain of
  expertise:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Artificial intelligence and astrology may seem wholly irreconcilable with one another; while the former
      exemplifies the apex of scientific innovation and technology, the latter is a scientifically discredited belief
      system associated with magic, spirituality and the occult. However, they are remarkably congruent: both are
      resolutely concerned with making forecasts and producing meaning about the world through processes of pattern
      recognition."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="water">Water seeds to deepen your Reflection</h3>
<p>As exciting as it would be to look into a crystal ball to see the future of humanity and AI, we‚Äôd like to remind you
  that we still have the power to influence this future through the stories we tell. Your mind might likely wander
  towards the dystopic, dark visions of the future that mainstream sci-fi movies and series usually show, but here‚Äôs a
  friendly reminder that those are not our only options.</p>
<p>If you could use a bit of hope and positive visions, we invite you to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://futureofbeinghuman.com/p/how-can-stories-unlock-pathways-to">watch The Assignment</a>, a short film
  that explores how stories can help us discover paths to different futures. The short film is a trailer for The&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.climatealmanac.org/">Climate Action Almanac</a>, a collection of visions of positive climate
  futures.</p>
<p>If you are keen to dive into more hopeful climate visions, be sure to also explore Grist‚Äôs&nbsp;<a
    href="https://grist.org/imagine2200-climate-fiction-2024/">Imagine 2200: Climate Fiction for Future
    Ancestors</a>&nbsp;short story contest. And, even more importantly, share these stories with others.</p>
<p>If you prefer to listen to podcasts, we also recommend the episode&nbsp;<a

    href="https://www.resilience.org/holding-the-fire-podcast/episodes/">Holding the Fire</a>. This particular episode
  reminded us about the power of dreaming, community, and the importance of committing to take better care of each other
  and the planet.</p>
