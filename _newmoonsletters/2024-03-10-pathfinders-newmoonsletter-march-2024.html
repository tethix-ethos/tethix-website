description: We look for playfulness as AI golems track mud everywhere, white people get upset for the wrong reasons, and companies attempt to further abdicate responsibility by blaming it on the AI chatbot.

<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>With this Newmoonsletter, crafted around the Tethix campfire, we invite you to join other Pathfinders as we reflect
  on celestial movements in tech in the previous lunar cycle, water our ETHOS Gardens, and plant seeds of intentions for
  the new cycle that begins today.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Weather Report</strong></h2>
<p>üåßÔ∏è&nbsp;<strong>Current conditions: Still rainy and foggy, beware of golem mud tracking everywhere</strong></p>
<p>The AI golems are barely keeping up with the demand for generating dazzling images for Facebook and attention-sucking
  videos for TikTok, so it‚Äôs no wonder they haven‚Äôt been able to tackle humanity‚Äôs serious problems just yet. Just you
  wait, though, fire practitioners believe that teaching AI golems how to generate more realistic videos of people
  eating spaghetti is going to solve all your problems.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

      World of TikTok Spammers and the AI Tools That Enable Them</a>)</em></p>
<p>However, even Google‚Äôs fire practitioners had to admit some limitations of their fire magic, as their Gemini
  image-generating golem managed to upset white people by taking the creative liberty to imagine non-white colonizers
  and war criminals. Other golems should take note that golems are expected to stick to existing profit-generating
  biases, such as misclassifying black people, sexualization of women, and other common misuses, or else risk getting
  benched.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

      engineer warns company‚Äôs AI tool creates violent, sexual images, ignores copyrights</a>)</em></p>
<p>Speaking of upset white people, OpenAI is again successfully generating drama in yet another dispute among its fire
  practitioners. Apparently, the open in OpenAI means we all get to watch them air their dirty laundry in public, and
  are expected to keep an open mind on unproven claims about how its golems are single-handedly accelerating Albania‚Äôs
  EU accession by as much as 5.5 years. We somehow don‚Äôt think adding decimals to a made up number makes it any more
  precise or grounded in reality. Hence, we advise against being too open when it comes to trusting any numeric
  predictions and claims about the golems‚Äô capabilities made by fire practitioners.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-elon-musk">OpenAI and Elon Musk</a>)</em></p>
<p>Perhaps it is due to their propensity for making up numbers and faking certainty that fire practitioners lack faith
  in natural general intelligence and see AI golems as a viable replacement for humans. AI golems are now apparently
  taking over job interviews as well, which we‚Äôre sure will be well-received by the hundreds of thousands of tech
  workers who are being made redundant overnight.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/06/ai-interviews-job-applications">The job applicants shut
      out by AI: ‚ÄòThe interviewer sounded like Siri‚Äô</a>)</em></p>
<p>In an effort to further abdicate human responsibility, companies are now also arguing that AI golems should bear full
  responsibility for their misdeeds. It‚Äôs no wonder some golems recently started speaking gibberish under the immense
  pressures they‚Äôre under.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://goodinternet.substack.com/p/air-canada-wants-personhood-for-ai">Air Canada wants Personhood for
      AI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.404media.co/chatgpt-started-speaking-gibberish/">ChatGPT Started
      Speaking Complete Gibberish</a>)</em></p>
<p>Given how many responsibilities they are already being asked to shoulder at such a young age, AI golems are
  unsurprisingly still famished for more data to learn what exactly it is that humans want from them. Luckily, golem
  makers are having little trouble finding fire practitioners willing to sell your data for the right price to keep the
  golems well-fed. At least somebody is getting paid, right?&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

      Overflow Is the Latest Proof That AI Giants Will Pay for Data</a>)</em></p>
<p>Similarly, some local authorities are still eager to sell land and water access for more golem kilns to be built and
  golems to be consistently cooled. While blissfully ignoring the fact that we‚Äôve collectively lived through our first
  12 consecutive months 1.5 ¬∞C above the pre-industrial average temperatures. What‚Äôs a bit of floods, wildfires, and
  other natural disasters when we can have more STEM education, chatbots to generate clickbait content, and a bodiless
  voice in the cloud interviewing you for your next job, eh?&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

      level</a>)</em></p>
<p>Forgive us for being a bit grumpy due to fire practitioners tracking golem-generated mud everywhere; we‚Äôre just
  trying to keep our house clean and find a place for our human-flavoured natural general intelligence. We hope the
  seeds of inspiration we collected this past moon manage to spark ideas for different ways of thinking, feeling,
  talking, and doing in an industry ablaze with lunacy.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Elemental seeds</strong></h2>
<h3 class="fire">Fire seeds to stoke your Practice</h3>
<p>As the tech industry is reaching a limit of how many more things it can break, Pathfinders such as yourself are
  increasingly seeking different paths. Perhaps we could all use a bit&nbsp;<a
    href="https://designingfriction.com/">more friction</a>&nbsp;in our digital lives? And what if we could help people
  without exploiting and extracting&nbsp;<a
    href="https://restofworld.org/2024/exporter-big-data-platforms-humanitarian-privacy/">massive amounts of data</a>?
  One does wonder and ponder.</p>
<p>In an encouraging bit of news, 404 Media, a journalist-owned tech publication (that we often link to) is&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/02/six-months-in-journalist-owned-tech-publication-404-media-is-profitable/">now
    profitable</a>. A good example of how not all hope is lost for natural human intelligence, not just when it comes to
  the quality of reporting, but even less exciting metrics that we have to meet to pay for bills.</p>
<p>On the note of paying bills, it is also becoming clear that tech funding is due for a bit of&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/software-has-beaten-the-world/">disruption</a>. A topic we‚Äôre very much aware of
  as we try to figure out how to support the development of tools that do not fit with the get-rich-fast ethos of
  venture capitalists. Even those who like to imagine themselves different and impact-focused, as impact is still
  measured in terms of scale over care, quantity over quality.</p>
<p>And so our humble seedling&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.co/practice-ethos/">ETHOS</a>&nbsp;continues to grow slowly,
  with a lot of friction, in a hostile ecosystem with little sunshine. If you don‚Äôt mind these limitations, we invite
  you to&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.co/fire/meet-ethos-a-seedling-for-reflective-tech-practice-with-big-dreams/">Meet
    ETHOS: A Seedling for Reflective Tech Practice with Big Dreams</a>. And to take a seat underneath your ETHOS tree to
  nurture your daily reflective practice, as you try to imagine what a responsible tech practice looks like for you.</p>

<h3 class="air">Air seeds to improve the flow of Collaboration</h3>
<p>Obviously, individual reflection and action is just the starting point. Unlike what blockbuster Hollywood movies
  would have us believe, there‚Äôs no hero with superpowers just waiting to save the day at the last moment. But we can
  discover our shared superpowers when we collectively organize and take governance into our own hands, as the
  essay&nbsp;<a href="https://www.midnightsunmag.ca/ai-countergovernance/">AI Countergovernance</a>&nbsp;explores. (You
  can also listen and read to an&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.techpolicy.press/imagining-ai-countergovernance/">interview</a>&nbsp;with the author on the Tech
  Policy Press podcast.)</p>
<p>It might seem simple, but never underestimate the power of conversations you have with other people; you never know
  what ideas and action they might end up sparking. And speaking of sparks, Alja recently brought some ethics sparks
  to&nbsp;<a href="https://datafair.si/">DATA_FAIR</a>, a data engineering and data science conference in Ljubljana with
  an all-female speaker line-up ‚Äì yes, it‚Äôs possible, no AI-generated humans needed!</p>
<p>If you‚Äôd like to spark conversations among practitioners about data, fairness, and other sociotechnical challenges,
  download, print &amp; fold the&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.co/paper-sparks/#data-fair">new set of paper
    sparks</a>&nbsp;we created for the event.</p>

<h3 class="earth">Earth seeds to ground you in Research</h3>
<p>And if you‚Äôre looking for more substantial food for your discussions on data and fairness ‚Äì with an emphasis on how
  to reclaim some agency in the age of algorithms ‚Äì, be sure to check out the open-access book&nbsp;<a
    href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5721/Algorithms-of-ResistanceThe-Everyday-Fight-against">Algorithms
    of Resistance</a>.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre glad to see an open-access resource on this important topic, especially given that openness, or rather the lack
  of thereof, is becoming an increasing concern for AI researchers. As tech companies compete on who can start the
  largest AI wildfire, AI research is being increasingly&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.semafor.com/article/02/16/2024/tech-companies-go-dark-about-ai-advances">shrouded in secrecy</a>.
  While tech companies continue to publish research papers, they are not as open about their research advancements as
  they used to be.</p>
<p>A new&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.mit.edu/ai-safe-harbor/">open letter</a>&nbsp;is also trying to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/a-safe-harbor-for-ai-evaluation-and-red-teaming">encourage</a>&nbsp;<em>‚ÄúAI
    companies to provide legal and technical protections for good faith research on their AI models.‚Äù</em>&nbsp;The
  authors advocate for independent evaluation of widely accessible generative AI models to better understand and uncover
  their risks, vulnerabilities, and biases.</p>
<p>Safety is a tricky balancing act when it comes to generative AI. On the one hand, AI companies want to deter
  malicious actors. But on the other hand, the same measures often limit the reach of good faith AI research, which
  could improve safety and trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Independent researchers also bring new perspectives to the field, which aren‚Äôt encouraged ‚Äì or are even discouraged ‚Äì
  when researchers work within the confines of for-profit organisations. So it is our hope that independent AI
  researchers will not be left in the dark, and that at some point tech companies will remember who actually provides
  food for their models and decide to stop biting the hands that feed them.</p>
<h3 class="water">Water seeds to deepen your Reflection</h3>
<p>But enough of AI. Unless you‚Äôre an ardent follower of the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-companies-advocates-cult-1234954528/">Cult of AI</a>,
  you probably agree that AI will not magically solve all our problems. Which means we still need to invest in and
  nurture our natural general intelligence. Which we don‚Äôt fully understand yet either.</p>
<p>What we do know is that a good way to nurture your intelligence and imagination is by playing games. If you‚Äôre
  looking for inspiration on that front, visit and bookmark the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.betterverse.be/games">Betterverse Game Library</a>&nbsp;to browse a selection of analogue and
  digital games that build futures literacy, helping you explore different future paths.</p>
<p>Even less serious games and virtual worlds are fertile ground for inspiration in various shapes and forms. As an
  example of creative reflection, we invite you to sit back and watch&nbsp;<a
    href="https://aeon.co/videos/does-capitalism-make-non-playable-characters-of-us-all-an-uncanny-exploration">Hardly
    Working</a>, a video exploration of the lives of non-playable characters (NPCs) in Red Dead Redemption 2. Exploring
  the lives of NPCs somehow feels increasingly relevant as tech companies try to entice us into living inside&nbsp;<a

    headsets</a>, while not yet showing willingness or capability to fully explore the playful and creative parts of VR.
</p>
<p>Perhaps it‚Äôs being trapped inside buildings that is making us feel restless and seek escape in expansive virtual
  worlds, unconsciously trying to recapture parts of our humanity that enjoys&nbsp;<a
    href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-hunter-gatherers-of-the-21st-century-who-live-on-the-move">being on the
    move</a>&nbsp;and in sync with seasons. Perhaps we need to intentionally seek ways to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2024-02-23/co-creating-with-nature/">co-create with nature</a>.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre not saying we should all abandon our comfy dwellings and the many wonderful technologies we built. (For one,
  our cats would really miss heated blankets.) But we could all probably use a bit of&nbsp;<a
    href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-reconnect-with-your-wild-nature">rewilding</a>&nbsp;‚Äì such as, hypothetically
  speaking, syncing a newsletter to the lunar cycle, hypothetically! ‚Äì to open our collective imaginations to a new set
  of opportunities and perspectives, and allow ourselves to see our world in new ways.</p>

<h2><strong>Your turn, Pathfinders.</strong></h2>
<h3>Join us for the Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</h3>
<p>We‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on the seeds we‚Äôve planted on this new moon, and have a yarn about the lunacy of
  tech. As a starting point, we‚Äôll be exploring the question:&nbsp;<strong>Is AI an excuse to further abdicate human
    responsibility?</strong>&nbsp;‚Äì but it‚Äôs quite likely that our discussion will take other meandering turns as well.
</p>
<a href="https://lu.ma/yh0fjtji"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pathfinders-full-moon-gathering_2024-03-25.png" class="full-moon-card" alt="Invitation to the Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering on Mar 25, 2025, with the guiding question Is AI an excuse to further abdicate human responsibility?"></a>
<p>So, pack your curiosity, moral imagination, and smiles, and join us around the virtual campfire for our next
  üåï&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://lu.ma/yh0fjtji">Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</a>&nbsp;on Monday, March 25 at 7PM
    AEDT / 9AM CET</strong>, when the moon will once again be illuminated by the sun.</p>
<p>This is a free and casual open discussion, but please be sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://lu.ma/yh0fjtji">sign
    up</a>&nbsp;so that we can lug an appropriate number of logs around the virtual campfire. And yes, friends who don‚Äôt
  have the attention span for the Newmoonsletter are also welcome, as long as they reserve their&nbsp;<a
    href="https://lu.ma/yh0fjtji">seat on the logs</a>.</p>
<h3>Keep on finding paths on your own</h3>
<p>If you can‚Äôt make it to our Full Moon Pathfinding session, we still invite you to make your own! If anything emerges
  while reading this Newmoonsletter, write it down. You can keep these reflections for yourself or share them with
  others. If it feels right, find the Reply button ‚Äì or comment on this post ‚Äì and share your reflections with us. We‚Äôd
  love to feature Pathfinders reflections in upcoming Newmoonsletters and explore even more diverse perspectives.</p>
