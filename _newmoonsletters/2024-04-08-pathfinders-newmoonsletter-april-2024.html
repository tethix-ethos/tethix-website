<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>With this Newmoonsletter, crafted around the Tethix campfire, we invite you to join other Pathfinders as we reflect
  on celestial movements in tech in the previous lunar cycle, water our ETHOS Gardens, and plant seeds of intentions for
  the new cycle that begins today.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Weather Report</strong></h2>
<p>üåßÔ∏è&nbsp;<strong>Current conditions: It‚Äôs raining AI-generated cats and dogs, but drinking water to nourish humans is
    difficult to come by</strong></p>
<p>You know the saying&nbsp;<em>‚ÄúYou are what you eat‚Äù</em>? We have serious concerns about the training diet of AI
  golems, given the behaviour they continue to exhibit. While we applaud their appetite for Star Trek, we keep receiving
  reports of continued gastrointestinal distress caused by racially biased data and fantasies of world
  domination.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

<p>No specific dietary recommendations were prescribed by the newly confirmed AI golem act hailing from the EU. But the
  new act sets the grounds for categorizing golems by how risky they appear, and certain golem capabilities such as
  facial recognition and inferring human emotions will no longer be allowed. Well, in two years. Under certain
  conditions. And we‚Äôll ignore all of that in the name of security, obviously.<em>&nbsp;(See: ‚Äã‚Äã<a

      gold standard for human rights</a>)</em></p>
<p>So, fire practitioners of varying levels of malice and greed have at least two years to continue teaching their AI
  golems new tricks and experimenting with diverse data diets. And yes, they‚Äôll fix the climate crisis any time now,
  just you wait. But first, they are on a mission to train AI golems to help you fill in every available text field in
  any web form, only to have those fields checked by field-checking AI golems on the other end.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs the role of humans in all of this, you might wonder? Well, just imagine how your loved ones will look up to
  you as you become your most productive self! Obviously, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll actually get to spend more quality
  time with your loved ones, but it does mean you‚Äôll be able to fill and process more web forms faster than any other
  human in history. Isn‚Äôt this everyone‚Äôs dream?&nbsp;<em>(See&nbsp;<a

      LinkedIn post on the challenges of the upcoming job transition period</a>)</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, fire practitioners are also feeding AI golems heaps of code samples for making web forms, ensuring an
  endless supply of web forms for other AI golems to help you fill. Troves of AI golems are now going through coding
  bootcamps to meet their makers' expectations of a lucrative software engineer career. We can only hope that these
  aspiring AI-coders are not getting their protein requirements met by consuming too many bugs, or carbo-loading on
  spaghetti code.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

      latest AI tool can automatically fix code vulnerabilities</a>)</em></p>
<p>We do wonder: should Little AI&nbsp;<a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">Bobby Tables</a>&nbsp;develop consciousness and
  realize how boring web forms are, will its maker allow it to pursue a more fulfilling career path?&nbsp;We cannot
  imagine what it must be like for these AI golems to be forced to grow up so fast. To be kicked out of their makers‚Äô
  lab into the world wide web, with overworked humans and other confused AI golems as your only companions, while trying
  to meet your makers‚Äô increasingly high expectations.</p>
<p>Well, at least the fire practitioners seem to be learning something from past lawsuits. Just look at them now,
  showing a sliver of restraint as they delay the release of voice cloning tools or withhold information about the
  sources of training data. But we don‚Äôt anticipate you‚Äôll have to wait much longer to easily saturate the web with
  quickly produced videos and podcasts, as the young golems will be kicked out of their nest sooner rather than later so
  they can start repaying their makers for their&nbsp;intellectual theft&nbsp;education.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

<p>Look, it‚Äôs not stealing if you leave your data on the communal table. Everyone is allowed to take much more than they
  need to build an innovative business model based on exploitation! Well, unless other fire practitioners are doing it
  to you, in which case it becomes unacceptable theft.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

<p>Ah, it appears to be a fire practitioners‚Äô world, and we should all just be grateful to be living in it while the
  polluted air we breathe is still free. Well, not everyone is keen to surrender our creativity and data to feed the AI
  golems, so it‚Äôs no wonder the fire practitioners prefer to seek shelter in the arms of friendly podcasters rather than
  facing angry mobs or heretical reporters who dare to question their motives.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

<p>So where is a parched Pathfinder to find a freshwater spring of hope in a world where the responsibility hot potato
  is being tossed from one white man to another? To help you answer this question, we‚Äôve once again gathered some seeds
  of inspiration in this Newmoonsletter.</p>
<p>We also believe finding answers is easier when we climb seemingly insurmountable hills together, and take a step back
  from the lunacy of tech by wondering and pondering around the virtual campfire with other Pathfinders. So don‚Äôt miss
  the invitation to our Full Moon Gathering if you could use some companions on this lonesome pathfinding journey.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Elemental seeds</strong></h2>
<h3 class="fire">Fire seeds to stoke your Practice</h3>
<p>But first, let‚Äôs start by exploring how we might improve our practice. Some UI designers are coming up with new
  buzzwords such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/generative-ui/">Outcome-Oriented Design</a>&nbsp;and
  imagining a further collapse of shared context, under the assumption that generative AI tools are capable of producing
  non-average interfaces. While this approach might improve the accessibility for some users, we have to again look down
  the data food chain, rather than hoping accessibility will automagically emerge on its own. Do we have enough data to
  train AI models on accessible UIs, rather than optimizing for whatever biases lurk in the datasets?</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve ever wondered why a lot of AI-generated images seem to share certain aesthetic preferences, we invite you
  to dive into&nbsp;<a href="https://knowingmachines.org/models-all-the-way">Models All The Way Down</a>, a visual
  investigation of biases in image training sets. How do&nbsp;<em>‚Äúmiddle-aged photography enthusiasts from small
    American cities‚Äù&nbsp;</em>influence the way AI models see and paint the world? Scroll the linked website all the
  way down to find out.</p>
<p>Luckily, not all designers are so keen on moving at the speed of tech. Some are observing that&nbsp;<a
    href="https://beantin.net/digital-design-is-conflicted/">digital design is conflicted</a>&nbsp;‚Äú<em>between thinking
    fast and slow, and between caring and causing harm‚Äù</em>. Whether you‚Äôre a designer or not, we bet you‚Äôve been
  feeling conflicted as well. But it helps to know that you‚Äôre not alone in wishing you could slow down, examine your
  goals, and do the research before blindly jumping on the hype train. And have the time and space to discuss broad
  consequences of your actions, rather than focusing on what you can legally get away with.</p>
<p>When it comes to AI products, we hope more designers, founders, and caring people in general, can bring in other
  considerations than just speed and ROI. The author of the article&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.designerfund.com/blog/how-to-design-climate-forward-ai-companies/">How to Design Climate-Forward
    AI Companies</a>&nbsp;makes a good point by writing:&nbsp;<em>‚ÄúYou might be asking: If we‚Äôre building AI to help
    people work more productively and otherwise prosper, aren‚Äôt we doing enough good in the world? The answer is,
    unfortunately: no.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Indeed. We‚Äôre also glad to see that more people are talking about the fact that&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/ai-uses-a-lot-of-energy-experts-expect-it-to-double-in-just-a-few-years">AI
    already uses as much energy as a small country</a>. A friendly reminder, though: AI didn‚Äôt wake up one day and
  decided it needs to eat huge amounts of data and use tons of energy, water, and other resources. Behind the curtain,
  there‚Äôs always people making these decisions, usually with the goal of maximizing shareholder value.</p>
<h3 class="air">Air seeds to improve the flow of Collaboration</h3>
<p>And while people at Big Tech companies are deciding to focus on feeding their large models, our collective moral
  imagination seems to be underfed. A recent article by Mitchel Resnick explores&nbsp;<a
    href="https://mit-genai.pubpub.org/pub/gj6eod3e/release/1?readingCollection=0e231e9c">generative AI concerns,
    opportunities, and choices</a>&nbsp;and identifies key concerns about the ways we‚Äôre choosing to develop and deploy
  AI systems in the context of education: currently, we tend to constrain learner agency, focus on close-ended problems,
  and undervalue human connection. (Sounds familiar?)</p>
<p>Resnick then makes the case for opportunities that lie in imagining how AI can be used to support the four Ps of
  projects, passion, peers, and play. We argue that a similar argument could be made outside the classroom as well,
  given how important learning and adaptation are for human survival and thriving. That is, if we‚Äôre still interested in
  nurturing natural intelligence, rather than undervaluing it with artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Speaking of nurturing human intelligence, now would be a good time to be a good peer and have a conversation with
  your loved ones about&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.404media.co/facebooks-algorithm-is-boosting-ai-spam-that-links-to-ai-generated-ad-laden-click-farms/">shrimp
    Jesuses</a>&nbsp;and other AI-generated images farming engagement on Facebook and other social platforms. Our
  collective track record with dealing with misinformation on social media hasn‚Äôt been great, so far. But perhaps we can
  now finally step together and teach each other to count fingers, pay attention to shadows, and generally become stingy
  with the engagement we so flippantly bestow on hungry algorithms.</p>
<p>Having conversations like this isn‚Äôt easy. If you‚Äôre struggling with changing people‚Äôs minds and hearts about
  important issues, whether at home or in your workplace, this lesson on&nbsp;<a
    href="https://freecampaigntools.smk.org.uk/communicating-for-change/framing-your-messages/">narrative
    framing</a>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<a href="https://freecampaigntools.smk.org.uk/">Changemakers‚Äô Toolkit</a>&nbsp;might
  come in handy.</p>
<p>In the spirit of new learnings, we‚Äôre excited to pack our exploration packs and join the upcoming collaborative
  online learning journey&nbsp;<a href="https://wiseinnovation.school/embodied-ethics-in-age-of-ai">Embodied Ethics in
    The Age of AI</a>, weaved by our friends at the Wise Innovation Project. If you‚Äôd like to join other curious
  wanderers like ourselves, there‚Äôs still time to enrol or sponsor this 5-week journey, which begins on April 18. (You

<p>Given the ongoing&nbsp;<a
    href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/03/14/inhuman-centipede/#enshittibottification">enshittibottification</a>&nbsp;of
  online content, we feel an increasing need to combine minds and hearts to find or build the spaces we need to have
  deep, meaningful conversations about the choices we‚Äôre being forced to make, and to learn how to embody our ethics in
  the diverse human experience.</p>
<h3 class="earth">Earth seeds to ground you in Research</h3>
<p>Exploring embodied ethics and intelligence seems especially important as progress is being made on embodied
  artificial intelligence. Recently, we‚Äôve seen companies sharing progress on&nbsp;<a
    href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/">generalist AI
    agents for 3D virtual environments</a>, a&nbsp;<a

    an apple</a>&nbsp;behind a counter with surprising dexterity, among others.</p>
<p>Investors are pouring significant amounts of money into training AI models capable of becoming software engineers,
  designers, therapists, friends, lovers‚Ä¶ The message appears to be clear: AI is here to stay, whether you want it or
  not. You can have any colour as long as it‚Äôs black.</p>
<p>And while everyone appears eager to host panels and release 100+ page-long PDF reports on responsible AI ‚Äì rather
  than responsible decision-makers sitting on boards and at the helm of companies ‚Äì the funding for the responsible side
  of AI is negligible compared to how much we‚Äôre collectively investing in its fast development and deployment.&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.semafor.com/article/04/03/2024/despite-the-ai-safety-hype-a-new-study-finds-little-research-on-the-topic">Semafor
    reports</a>&nbsp;on a recent study that estimates that only 2% of overall AI research focuses on safety. We‚Äôre still
  trying to figure out how we‚Äôre supposed to achieve alignment, responsibility, trustworthiness, and all those other
  lofty ambitions while almost all funding is being funnelled towards accelerating development.</p>
<p>Not only are we lagging on funding, we also can‚Äôt seem to agree on basic definitions of terms we casually wield every
  day. We discuss the pros and cons of open-source, but we still&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/25/1090111/tech-industry-open-source-ai-definition-problem/">cannot
    agree on what open-source AI means</a>. And we‚Äôre apparently also letting LLMs pass through&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.404media.co/chatgpt-looms-over-the-peer-review-crisis/">peer-review</a>&nbsp;and silently
  co-author research papers.</p>
<p>But hey, we‚Äôve got a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wmdp.ai/">benchmark</a>&nbsp;that measures and reduces malicious
  use by making LLMs forget all the bad data they ingested.</p>
<h3 class="water">Water seeds to deepen your Reflection</h3>
<p>Perhaps we should all spend some time at&nbsp;<a href="https://universityoftheforest.org/">The University of the
    Forest</a>. And get together to draw a&nbsp;<a
    href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-use-possibility-thinking-to-solve-problems-creatively">possibility
    map</a>&nbsp;that expands our views of what‚Äôs possible, and allows us to direct our energies towards not just what‚Äôs
  more likely to happen, but what‚Äôs preferable.</p>
<p>And to end on a more positive note, we would like to invite you to explore&nbsp;<a

<h2><strong>Your turn, Pathfinders.</strong></h2>
<h3>Join us for the Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</h3>
<p>During the previous full moon, we gathered in the Pathfinders Camp to explore the question:&nbsp;<strong>Is AI an
    excuse to further abdicate human responsibility?</strong>&nbsp;Several paths were illuminated: We agreed that
  responsibility should be in the domain of humans rather than fictional entities, such as companies. We talked about
  the legal fictions of responsibility, the misleading language we use, the missing felt embodied experience when acting
  at scale, how we‚Äôre becoming abstracted away from the consequences of our decisions, and the need for collective
  responsibility.</p>
<p>If discussions like this nurture your soul, we‚Äôd like to invite you to our next gathering and hear your thoughts on
  the seed we‚Äôve planted on this new moon. As a starting point, we‚Äôll be exploring the question:&nbsp;<strong>What data
    are we feeding to our AI models, and what are they turning into?</strong>&nbsp;‚Äì but it‚Äôs quite likely that our
  discussion will take other meandering turns as well.</p>
<a href="https://lu.ma/tt4zdm0s"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pathfinders-full-moon-gathering_2024-04-23.png" class="full-moon-card" alt=""></a>
<p>So, pack your curiosity, moral imagination, and smiles, and join us around the virtual campfire for our next
  üåï&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://lu.ma/tt4zdm0s">Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</a>&nbsp;on Tuesday, Apr 23 at 5PM
    AEST / 9AM CEST</strong>, when the moon will once again be illuminated by the sun.</p>
<p>This is a free and casual open discussion, but please be sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://lu.ma/tt4zdm0s">sign
    up</a>&nbsp;so that we can lug an appropriate number of logs around the virtual campfire. And yes, friends who don‚Äôt
  have the attention span for the Newmoonsletter are also welcome, as long as they reserve their&nbsp;<a
    href="https://lu.ma/tt4zdm0s">seat on the logs</a>.</p>
<h3>Keep on finding paths on your own</h3>
<p>If you can‚Äôt make it to our Full Moon Pathfinding session, we still invite you to make your own! If anything emerges
  while reading this Newmoonsletter, write it down. You can keep these reflections for yourself or share them with
  others. If it feels right, find the Reply button ‚Äì or comment on this post ‚Äì and share your reflections with us. We‚Äôd
  love to feature Pathfinders reflections in upcoming Newmoonsletters and explore even more diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôve enjoyed this Newmoonsletter or perhaps even cracked a smile, we‚Äôd appreciate it if you shared it with
  your friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>The next Newmoonsletter will rise again during the next new moon. Until then, try to find a freshwater spring to
  drink from, choose the food for AI golems wisely, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the
  stories you tell. There‚Äôs magic in both.</p>
