description: This new moon, we counter the AI-assisted dematerialisation of the workforce and disembodiment of knowledge by delving into weirdness, grandmotherly wisdom, communal gardens, a new podcast, and more.
---

<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>With this Newmoonsletter, crafted around the Tethix campfire, we invite you to join other Pathfinders as we reflect
  on celestial movements in tech in the previous lunar cycle, water our ETHOS Gardens, and plant seeds of intentions for
  the new cycle that begins today.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Weather Report</strong></h2>
<p>üèúÔ∏è&nbsp;<strong>Current conditions: AI-generated rain just doesn‚Äôt help flowers grow the same way</strong></p>
<p>Watch out! The fire practitioners of Silicon Valley keep speeding up their quest to dematerialise the workforce and
  disembody our knowledge by releasing more AI golems into the world. All this speed and scale comes at a cost though.
  We have observed that the AI-generated rain of the past cycles has left our online communal gardens parched. Our
  flowers just aren‚Äôt blooming the way they used to, but at least the flowers in Antarctica seem to be
  thriving.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

      Floral Awakening: How Climate Change is Transforming the Continent‚Äôs Ecosystem</a>)</em></p>
<p>Blissfully or wilfully unaware, the fire practitioners who are fuelling the wildfires of generative AI while warning
  us of their existential risks, are now being asked to advise on how to safely start wildfires on critical
  infrastructure. Who better to ensure safety than the people with first-hand experience with unsafe and rash behaviour,
  right? We wonder, do pyromaniacs really make the best firefighters?&nbsp;<em>(See: ‚Äã‚Äã<a
      href="https://qz.com/sam-altman-jensen-huang-ai-government-safety-board-1851437593">OpenAI's Sam Altman, Nvidia's
      Jensen Huang, and other tech leaders are joining a new federal AI safety board</a>)</em></p>
<p>Scholars are starting to warn fire practitioners that the information superhighway might not be able to grow organic
  data for starving AI golems to feed on for much longer. Despite experiencing face-scanning orb shortages and impacts
  on day-to-day operation after dematerialising their workforce, fire practitioners keep believing that their will and
  billions will conquer any and all physical limits. We worry they took the 90ies pop classic about&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kmEEkECFQw">no limits</a>&nbsp;too literally.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

      CEO Daniel Ek surprised by how much laying off 1,500 employees negatively affected the streaming giant‚Äôs
      operations</a>)</em></p>
<p>Given the insatiable desires of fire practitioners, lab-grown datasets seems to be the future of food for training AI
  golems. We‚Äôre not yet sure how further disembodied knowledge is going to help AI golems understand our world better,
  but perhaps that‚Äôs not what the fire practitioners are after. Corporate jobs have never been particularly in touch
  with physical realities, so it‚Äôs no wonder that AI golems are finding it fairly easy to slip into new opportunities in
  hiring, as well as competing on unrealistic beauty standards, and taking on other&nbsp;<a
    href="https://weirdpeople.fas.harvard.edu/qa-weird">WEIRD</a>&nbsp;‚Äì Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich,
  Democratic ‚Äì roles.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymanai.com/">Payman ‚Äì AI That Pays Humans</a>,&nbsp;<a

      AI-Generated Population Is Here, and They‚Äôre Ready to Work</a>)</em></p>
<p>It‚Äôs hard to out-WEIRD fire practitioners and their AI golems, which is why we‚Äôre trying to be more weird and less
  WEIRD in our newly launched&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast">Pathfinders Podcast</a>. We hope the
  seeds of inspiration we gathered in this Newmoonsletter can also help you embrace your weirdness in the increasingly
  lunatic tech industry. Perhaps even inspire you to come up with your own rainmaking ritual or dance to invite some
  non-AI-generated rain into your online communal gardens.</p>

<h3 class="fire">Fire seeds to stoke your Practice</h3>
<p>As tech roles get turned into process-heavy checklists that make it easier for AI models to fit in with their
  averaged outputs, tech workers wonder about their role in digital product factories. We keep coming across reports
  that product management&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.mindtheproduct.com/the-truth-hurts-but-in-many-companies-product-management-is-broken/">is
    broken</a>, product design&nbsp;<a href="https://designsystems.international/ideas/product-design-is-lost/">is
    lost</a>, front-end developers are having an&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.ellyloel.com/blog/front-end-development-s-identity-crisis/">identity crisis</a>‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs starting
  to seem like human intelligence is becoming increasingly undervalued in this brave new AI-assisted world.</p>
<p>While AI models seem to be getting pretty good at linear reasoning, humans possess&nbsp;<a
    href="https://bigthink.com/business/why-a-neurodivergent-team-will-be-a-golden-asset-in-the-ai-workplace/">wonderful
    diversity</a>&nbsp;when it comes to atypical cognitive strategies, such as lateral thinking, creative
  problem-solving, and intuitive insights. Companies that want to build better products should learn how to make space
  for human neurodiversity, both in their hiring and in building more&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/04/ai-neurodiversity-building-inclusive-tools/">inclusive products</a>.
</p>
<p>Despite the talk, most organisations are still in the early stages of their inclusivity journey, especially when it
  comes to embracing a more&nbsp;<a
    href="https://hbr.org/2022/06/an-intersectional-approach-to-inclusion-at-work">intersectional view of human
    inclusivity</a>. Perhaps projects like the&nbsp;<a href="https://aidatabase.mozilla.org/">AI Intersections
    Database</a>&nbsp;by Mozilla can help more people learn about the way AI impacts people around the world and find
  organisations working at intersections of social justice, human rights, and AI impacts.</p>
<p>Sadly, this year organisations seem mostly focused on making workplaces more AI-inclusive. Perhaps the greater
  inclusion of AI assistants will help us to rethink the language we use in product development. As AI models become
  users of the user interfaces we build, we might finally be ready to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/04/19/1090872/ai-users-people-terms/">retire the term
    ‚Äúuser‚Äù</a>&nbsp;when talking about humans and replace it with the more humane term ‚Äúperson‚Äù.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to observe how language will change as more AI ‚Äúusers‚Äù enter our digital spaces. People are
  already&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/16/techscape-ai-gadgest-humane-ai-pin-chatgpt">reporting</a>&nbsp;a
  curious increase of ChatGPT-favoured words like ‚Äúdelve‚Äù and ‚Äútapestry‚Äù as more people entrust their writing to AI
  assistants. We‚Äôre actually excited about the possibility of ChatGPT helping people embark on a journey of linguistic
  discovery and enrichment, although we hope the newly minted AI-assisted writers will also take the time to delve into
  the meaning of newly (re)discovered words, perhaps even get curious about their&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/delve">etymology</a>? (The later a favourite pastime of ours.)</p>
<p>And while AI-influenced language is likely here to stay ‚Äì at least until we‚Äôre willing to allocate enough energy,
  water, and other resources to keep the AI golems running ‚Äì, new&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.mightybytes.com/blog/digital-greenwashing-guide/">greenwashing regulations</a>&nbsp;will hopefully
  temper the ridiculous green claims that are increasingly common on websites and other digital products.</p>
<p>While we‚Äôre on the topic of misleading claims, more people are now&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/any-technology-indistinguishable-from-magic-is-hiding-something/">questioning</a>&nbsp;the
  magic of the cloud, and the infrastructure and (cyber)land grabbing tendencies of Big Tech, reminding us that we need
  to fight for our weird corners of the indie web.&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.citationneeded.news/we-can-have-a-different-web/">This newsletter</a>&nbsp;reminds us that the old
  web a lot of us yearn for is still out there, but it‚Äôs up to us to start planting our online gardens outside the
  walled gardens owned by Big Tech giants. When was the last time you made your own little, weird corner on the web just
  for yourself?</p>
<h3 class="air">Air seeds to improve the flow of Collaboration</h3>
<p>Interestingly enough, there is a special kind of weird brewing inside Big Tech‚Äôs walled gardens. We‚Äôre less concerned
  about people delving into new linguistic territories in their AI-assisted LinkedIn posts, than the proliferation of
  AI-generated spam on social networks, including&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.404media.co/facebooks-bizarre-ai-images-now-on-linkedin-too/">LinkedIn</a>. 404media has
  christened Facebook&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.404media.co/facebooks-ai-spam-isnt-the-dead-internet-its-the-zombie-internet/">the zombie
    internet</a>, where bots and humans are finding strange ways to coexist and keep the engagement algorithms humming
  and the advertising money rolling in.</p>
<p>To counter that, people are not only planting their own online gardens outside Big Tech lands, but also building new
  communal gardens:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/latest-online-culture-war-is-humans-vs-algorithms/">online
    social platforms designed to be algorithm-free</a>. The recently planted&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.pi.fyi/home/following">PI.FYI</a>&nbsp;feels more like MySpace than Facebook, and instead of
  selling people‚Äôs attention to the highest bidder, people support the platform by subscribing. How refreshing!</p>
<p>Social infrastructure, both online and offline, is crucial for building community and creating&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.planetcritical.com/p/social-tipping-points">social tipping points</a>. We need to claim or build
  online places for collaboration and diverse discussions to stand a chance of discovering different paths to better
  tech futures. The Newmoonsletter and other&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.co/pathfinders/">Pathfinding
    activities</a>&nbsp;are our humble offering to this space, and we‚Äôre always happy when we see new places and
  communal gardens appear.</p>
<p>An online communal garden we started visiting lately is the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiseinnovation.school/">Wise
    Innovation Project</a>. Recently, we had the honour of being invited to the Project‚Äôs first&nbsp;<a
    href="https://vimeo.com/935068735">Show &amp; Tell office hours</a>&nbsp;to talk about our journey, ETHOS, and more.
</p>
<p>Currently, we are participating in the Project‚Äôs first online course,&nbsp;<a
    href="https://wiseinnovation.school/embodied-ethics-in-age-of-ai">Embodied Ethics in the Age of AI</a>, and
  connecting with many wonderful people who are trying to approach product development and tech ethics differently. If
  you‚Äôre curious about the themes we‚Äôre exploring in the course, we invite you to listen to Josh Schrei‚Äôs interview on
  the&nbsp;<a href="https://michaelgarfield.substack.com/p/219">Future Fossils podcast</a>, or sit back in a cosy chair
  and soak in some grandmotherly wisdom on embodied ethics in this&nbsp;<a
    href="https://vimeo.com/941757808?share=copy">guest session recording</a>.</p>
<p>We also keep exploring more embodied ways of having difficult discussions about AI ethics in our work. Check out our
  latest blog post&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.co/air/how-a-playful-dance-with-the-elements-can-help-broaden-perspectives-on-ai-ethics/">How a
    playful dance with the elements can help broaden perspectives on AI ethics</a>&nbsp;to learn how Mat used&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.co/paper-sparks/">Paper Elemental Sparks</a>&nbsp;to facilitate a more embodied exploration at
  a recent in-person event in Sydney.</p>
<h3 class="earth">Earth seeds to ground you in Research</h3>
<p>We can only imagine how different the tech industry would be if led by grandmothers or other leaders with the wisdom
  of embodied ethics. Instead, it‚Äôs being driven by what Timnit Gebru ‚Äì Google‚Äôs ousted AI ethics canary in a coal mine
  ‚Äì and collaborators call&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dair-institute.org/tescreal/">the TESCREAL
    bundle</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>‚Äútranshumanism, Extropianism, singularitarianism, (modern) cosmism, Rationalism,
    Effective Altruism, and longtermism‚Äù</em>.</p>
<p>Gebru‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/13636">latest paper</a>&nbsp;is a call
  for researchers to work on well-scoped and well-defined AI systems for which&nbsp;<em>‚Äúwe can develop safety
    protocols‚Äù</em>, rather than pursuing the mythical ‚Äì and poorly defined ‚Äì dream of AGI (artificial general
  intelligence), with concerning ties to the eugenics movement.</p>
<p>A recent comparison of how well OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and Google‚Äôs Gemini models understand cultural nuances&nbsp;<a
    href="https://news.hofstede-insights.com/news/does-artificial-intelligence-have-a-culture-problem">found both models
    lacking</a>&nbsp;in cultural understanding and nuance, and often resorting to cultural stereotypes. Gemini scored
  slightly better in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hofstede-insights.com/gemini-vs-chatgpt">comparison</a>, but still
  far from demonstrating good cultural literacy. This type of research is definitely something&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ai-generated-population-is-here-and-theyre-ready-to-work-16f8c764">companies</a>&nbsp;developing
  ‚Äúdigital twins‚Äù or AI personas should keep in mind, as AI models often fail to grasp nuances even when it comes to
  countries that are well-represented in the training datasets.</p>
<p>The recently released&nbsp;<a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/report/">AI Index Report 2024</a>&nbsp;by the
  Stanford‚Äôs Human-Centered AI center ‚Äì and generously supported by industry partners ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt concern itself with AI
  cultural literacy, but instead makes a point of highlighting how AI makes workers more productive and accelerates
  scientific discoveries ‚Äì even though the value of these highly publicised discoveries has recently been&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.404media.co/google-says-it-discovered-millions-of-new-materials-with-ai-human-researchers/">called
    into question</a>.</p>
<p>But hey, 4 pages out of the 502 pages heavy&nbsp;<a
    href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/HAI_2024_AI-Index-Report.pdf">AI Index
    Report</a>&nbsp;(p. 154‚Äì157) are dedicated to environmental impacts of AI systems, with a whooping five references
  to positive AI environmental use cases. It‚Äôs just a matter of time before ChatGPT figures out all our climate
  predicaments, just you wait! /s</p>
<p>If you work in education ‚Äì or are just generally curious like us ‚Äì, you might also want to check out&nbsp;<a
    href="https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/mcmasterpracticalaiguide/">The Curious Educator‚Äôs Guide to AI</a>, an
  openly licensed resource&nbsp;‚Äúdesigned to help educators and researchers better understand the evolving role of
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) in higher education‚Äù. While still selectively curious, it does offer plenty of valuable
  resources and exercises to help you understand and apply generative AI, especially in an educational setting.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôre looking for more creative visualisations of AI for your next presentation, Google DeepMind‚Äôs&nbsp;<a
    href="https://deepmind.google/discover/visualising-ai/">Visualising AI</a>&nbsp;project is freely available
  on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@googledeepmind">Unsplash</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.pexels.com/@googledeepmind/">Pexels</a>. For the project, DeepMind has commissioned ‚Äì and
  hopefully fairly compensated ‚Äì artists from around the world to create more diverse representations of AI. Worth
  exploring, but we‚Äôd also like to remind you that&nbsp;<a href="https://betterimagesofai.org/">Better Images of
    AI</a>&nbsp;also serves a similar purpose, while properly crediting and promoting the artists.</p>
<h3 class="water">Water seeds to deepen your Reflection</h3>
<p>Well, congrats, you‚Äôve made it to the pond of reflection where we take a sip of AI-free water together. It‚Äôs always a
  good idea to take a step back from the AI lunacy and seek inspiration beyond screens and apps.</p>
<p>If you enjoy board games, you might want to keep an eye out for the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/22/1245096795/catan-board-game-climate-change-pollution">release</a>&nbsp;of the
  new Catan board game. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.catan.com/catan-new-energies">Catan: New Energies</a>, the
  challenge is managing the energy needs for your society. You have to decide whether to invest in renewable energies or
  keep going with cheaper, but potentially disastrous fossil fuels.</p>
<p>We feel many politicians might learn a thing or two from playing this game without putting our actual futures at
  stake. Or perhaps we should send them copies of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.daybreakgame.org/">Daybreak</a>, a
  cooperative board game for ages 10+ about stopping climate change. Or start reading them&nbsp;<a
    href="https://girlsresistance.org/">Stories of Girls‚Äô Resistance</a>, a&nbsp;<em>‚Äúcollection of oral and narrative
    history of adolescent girls‚Äô activism‚Äù</em>&nbsp;from around the world, to spark their imagination and help them
  find the courage for meaningful action.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôre currently just exhausted from all the lunacy but have access to a garden, we invite you to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/19/letting-grass-grow-long-boosts-butterfly-numbers-uk-study-proves">let
    your grass grow long</a>&nbsp;and help improve local biodiversity by offering butterflies a safe haven on your lawn.
  Sometimes doing less is the answer.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôd like to keep exploring the lunacy of tech with us, we invite you to listen and subscribe to the freshly
  planted&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast">Pathfinders Podcast</a>&nbsp;wherever you get your
  podcasts. The podcast is a meandering exploration inspired by the seeds planted in the Newmoonsletter at the beginning
  of the lunation cycle, and the paths illuminated during the Full Moon Gathering.</p>
<p>The question that emerged in the&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/pathfinders-newmoonsletter-april">April
    Newmoonsletter</a>&nbsp;and guided our discussion is:&nbsp;<strong><a
      href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/what-data-are-we-feeding-to-our-al">What data are we feeding to our Al models,
      and what are they turning into?</a></strong>&nbsp;In the episode, we explore how AI models reflect our biases and
  why those biases surprise us. We seek the embodied aspect of wisdom, question existing mental models, examine
  similarities with rubber ducking, and wonder about how we both project and construct personalities of different AI
  models. We ponder how we might offer our lived experiences to the commons in a more fair value exchange that takes
  place when we provide data for training AI models.</p>
<p>We also aim to reclaim our collective agency as storytellers that can tip the AI bias in a different direction, and
  explore the need for greater diversity and woo in our data, and how we might make the AI data diets less WEIRD ‚Äì
  Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich and Democratic ‚Äì and more weird, or even woo.</p>
<p>Take a listen and join us at the next&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#full-moon">Full Moon
    Gathering</a>&nbsp;if you‚Äôd like to illuminate additional paths for our next episode!</p>
<h2><strong>Your turn, Pathfinders.</strong></h2>
<h3>Join us for the Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</h3>
<p>In this lunation cycle, we‚Äôre inviting Pathfinders to gather around our virtual campfire to explore the
  question:&nbsp;<strong>How do we nurture weird online communal gardens where we can play together?</strong>&nbsp;‚Äì but
  it‚Äôs quite likely that our discussion will take other meandering turns as well.</p>
<a href="https://lu.ma/tn8lenx0"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/pathfinders-full-moon-gathering_2024-05-23.png" class="full-moon-card" alt=""></a>
<p>So, pack your curiosity, moral imagination, and smiles, and join us around the virtual campfire for our next
  üåï&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://lu.ma/tn8lenx0">Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</a>&nbsp;on Thursday, May 23 at 5PM
    AEST / 9AM CEST</strong>, when the moon will once again be illuminated by the sun.</p>
<p>This is a free and casual open discussion, but please be sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://lu.ma/tn8lenx0">sign
    up</a>&nbsp;so that we can lug an appropriate number of logs around the virtual campfire. And yes, friends who don‚Äôt
  have the attention span for the Newmoonsletter are also welcome, as long as they reserve their&nbsp;<a
    href="https://lu.ma/tn8lenx0">seat on the logs</a>.</p>
<h3>Keep on finding paths on your own</h3>
<p>If you can‚Äôt make it to our Full Moon Pathfinding session, we still invite you to make your own! If anything emerges
  while reading this Newmoonsletter, write it down. You can keep these reflections for yourself or share them with
  others. If it feels right, find the Reply button ‚Äì or comment on this post ‚Äì and share your reflections with us. We‚Äôd
  love to feature Pathfinders reflections in upcoming Newmoonsletters and explore even more diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôve enjoyed this Newmoonsletter or perhaps even cracked a smile, we‚Äôd appreciate it if you shared it with
  your friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>The next Newmoonsletter will rise again during the next new moon. Until then, nurture your communal gardens with real
  water, stop and smell all the flowers you‚Äôre not allergic to, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant
  and the stories you tell. There‚Äôs magic in both.</p>
