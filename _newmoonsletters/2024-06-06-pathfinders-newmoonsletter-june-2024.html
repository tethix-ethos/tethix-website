<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>With this Newmoonsletter, crafted around the Tethix campfire, we invite you to join other Pathfinders as we reflect
  on celestial movements in tech in the previous lunar cycle, water our ETHOS Gardens, and plant seeds of intentions for
  the new cycle that begins today.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Weather Report</strong></h2>
<p>üèúÔ∏è&nbsp;<strong>Current conditions: Bring your own water, fire practitioners are squeezing everyone and everything
    dry</strong></p>
<p>Do not be fooled by the rainbows magically appearing on social media profiles this month. The fire practitioners of
  Silicon Valley are still focused on squeezing every last bit of productivity from the workers they haven‚Äôt yet fired.
  The race to deliver AI suggestions nobody asked for is still very much on! And if you‚Äôre getting strange answers, it‚Äôs
  basically your fault for asking it wrong, or not providing more free labour for higher quality training
  data.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

<p>Fire practitioners are graciously making AI golems available to millions of people around the world, and uncle Sam,
  Mark, and others need you. Regardless of whether you‚Äôre an A-list celebrity, an overworked tech worker, or just enjoy
  posting pics of your meals on Instagram, your data remains crucial for maintaining their growing AI golem army. They
  kindly ask you to think twice when ethical or legal concerns force them to give you the choice of opting out of AI
  training, the AI golems are starving! <em>(See: <a

<p>Besides, the latest great council of white men sees great strategic growth opportunities in the continued
  exploitation of your data. So be a good sport, and you might just get the privilege of paying extra subscriptions for
  AI golems who were trained on your data. AI golems will date, work, and think just for you, and yes, make fire
  practitioners richer. But who better to solve problems that shouldn‚Äôt exist than the people who helped them create in
  the first place, right?&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

<p>Meanwhile, OpenAI‚Äôs uncle Sam thinks ‚Äúwe‚Äù&nbsp;are not worried enough about the socioeconomic impacts of the AI
  golems his company keeps unleashing. By ‚Äúwe‚Äù he probably means his fellow fire practitioners who are focusing on
  crushing things; everyone&nbsp;<em>we</em>&nbsp;talk to seems pretty concerned about the current labour market,
  especially in tech and creative industries.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-says-ais-economic-impact-top-concern-2024-5">Sam Altman doesn't

<p>We also think uncle Sam and his friends aren‚Äôt worried enough about the environmental impacts of building and
  maintaining such large AI golem armies. To put it in terms they do understand:&nbsp;<em>‚Äúa 1C increase in global
    temperature leads to a 12% decline in world gross domestic product‚Äù</em>, a recent report finds. And&nbsp;<em>‚Äúthe
    world economy is committed to an income reduction of 19% within the next 26‚Äâyears independent of future emission
    choices‚Äù</em>, another study warns. All the greenwashing in the world doesn‚Äôt change the fact that renewable data
  centers don‚Äôt magically grow in the clouds and still need water to cool the growing armies of AI
  golems.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/16/microsoft_co2_emissions/">Microsoft's

<p>So, as the children of Silicon Valley continue playing with fire, water, and other resources to keep the machinery of
  AI running and putting our children into further ecological debt, we advise you to seek shade and shelter in weird
  communal gardens ‚Äì either online or offline ‚Äì, as explored in our&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/how-do-we-nurture-weird-online-communal">recent Pathfinders Podcast</a>. Uncle
  Sam, Mark, and others appear determined to squeeze us all dry in their pursuit of AGI and immortality, so be sure to
  bring your own drinking water while you still can, and share it with other Pathfinders generously. We hope the seeds
  of inspiration we collected in this Newmoonsletter can help you find paths to safe havens in this scorching AI
  landscape.</p>

  facing.</p>
<p>As tech bros keep dreaming of elusive AGI in the cloud, the real world keeps reminding us of how imperfect our
  technologies still are. The recently reported heat record in India turned out to be a&nbsp;<a

    Offline Club</a>, you can now pay for the privilege of hanging out with people in person without technology getting
  in the way.</p>
<h3 class="air">Air seeds to improve the flow of Collaboration</h3>
<p>While digital technologies are supporting collaboration at a scale never seen before, the current social
  infrastructure of the internet feels increasingly exhausting. As we discuss in the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/how-do-we-nurture-weird-online-communal">Pathfinders Podcast</a>, we need to
  intentionally nurture weird online places where we can be playful together, and hopefully create the right conditions
  for a&nbsp;<a href="https://newsletter.osv.llc/p/anatomy-of-a-scenius-i-the-canon">scenius</a>&nbsp;‚Äì collective
  genius ‚Äì to emerge in our communities.</p>
<p>However, the playful weirdness that leads to creativity and innovation also needs boundaries and rules that keep
  everyone safe. As corporations momentarily turn their attention from greenwashing to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/06/01/pride-month-rainbow-washing-lgbt-support-work/">rainbow-washing</a>,
  GLAAD ‚Äì the LGBTQ advocacy non-profit ‚Äì is here to point out that most social media platforms still don‚Äôt get a
  passing grade in their&nbsp;<a
    href="https://glaad.org/smsi/2024/summary-conclusions-reccomendations-methodology/">Social Media Safety Index</a>.
  GLAAD reminds us that while social media platforms continue&nbsp;<a
    href="https://glaad.org/smsi/2024/rising-hate-rising-profits/">profiteering from hate</a>, the lack of safety in
  online spaces also leads to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://glaad.org/smsi/2024/online-hate-tropes-connected-to-offline-harm/">serious offline harms</a>.</p>
<p>The move fast and break things approach is clearly breaking many things for many communities. That‚Äôs why people
  outside the VC-backed tech bubble tend to&nbsp;‚Äúthink different‚Äù, as Apple once advertised: from decentralised
  software on the&nbsp;<a href="https://fedidb.org/software">Fediverse</a>&nbsp;to the ideas and practices developed by
  Taiwan‚Äôs Digital Minister&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/6979012/audrey-tang-interview-plurality-democracy/">Audrey
    Tang</a>&nbsp;and her collaborators. The latter are now being presented in-depth in the open-source project and
  book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.plurality.net/">Plurality</a>, which is exploring how technology can enable diverse and
  open collaboration in different sectors. We can‚Äôt wait to dig into it!</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôre looking for additional inspiration on how to nurture healthier communities in different settings, we
  encourage you to explore the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.community-weaving.org/">Community Weaving</a>&nbsp;framework.
</p>
<h3 class="earth">Earth seeds to ground you in Research</h3>
<p>You‚Äôll rarely find people developing AI talking about nurturing healthier communities, but they do often talk about
  aligning AI to human values, or even more vaguely about&nbsp;<em>‚Äúbenefiting all humanity‚Äù</em>. An interesting goal
  given that recent research points to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46581-5">worldwide
    divergence of values</a>&nbsp;and makes the observation that WEIRD ‚Äì Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and
  Democratic ‚Äì subjects have become even WEIRD-er over the last forty years when it comes to their social and moral
  values. How will AI models, developed in WEIRD contexts, be able to deal with the divergence of values remains a
  mystery.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs clearly a need to involve people with more diverse expertise (and backgrounds) in the development of AI
  systems. This doesn‚Äôt mean just involving people in reinforcing model outputs with human feedback, but incorporating
  diverse perspectives at every step of the process. As an example, the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology‚Äôs AI
  Governance Lab has released&nbsp;<a
    href="https://cdt.org/insights/applying-sociotechnical-approaches-to-ai-governance-in-practice/">practical
    guidelines</a>&nbsp;on how to include social science and humanities expertise in the development and governance of
  AI systems. (Although we‚Äôd also add specifically seeking non-WEIRD sociotechnical expertise to the list.)</p>
<p>And while tech companies continue moving at the speed of tech, some are at least publishing better-intentioned
  papers, like the recently released&nbsp;<a
    href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/ethics-of-advanced-ai-assistants/the-ethics-of-advanced-ai-assistants-2024-i.pdf">Ethics
    of Advanced AI Assistants</a>, courtesy of Google DeepMind. (Yes, owned by the same Google who shipped the AI
  assistant that advises people to eat rocks.) The 200+ pages long paper is practically a book, so we
  appreciated&nbsp;<a href="https://futureofbeinghuman.com/p/navigating-ethics-of-advanced-ai-assistants">Andrew
    Maynard‚Äôs overview</a>&nbsp;and the highlighted reading guide.</p>
<p>Speaking of papers, academic publishers are now making it clear that AI assistants do not count as peers when it
  comes to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/08/2024/researchers-warned-against-using-ai-to-peer-review-academic-papers">peer
    review of scientific papers</a>&nbsp;‚Äì it appears AI assistants are only allowed to come after paid jobs. Good to
  know.</p>
<p>But fear not, Google DeepMind has also&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/17/2024/google-deepmind-launches-new-framework-to-assess-the-dangers-of-ai-models">released
    a new framework</a>&nbsp;that promises to warn humanity should an AI model appear to be approaching dangerous
  capabilities. In case you‚Äôre wondering: an increase in energy demands or resource usage is not considered a dangerous
  capability. Big tech companies continue to tell us that AI will help us tackle climate change, but preserving a
  liveable planet for our children and other species is not among the AI principles published by Google, Microsoft, or
  OpenAI. Go figure.</p>
<h3 class="water">Water seeds to deepen your Reflection</h3>
<p>This is usually the part where we try to inspire you and make you wonder about the beauty of the Universe. But this
  time, we wanted to reassure you that&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.planetcritical.com/p/duende-from-scream-to-song-at-the">it‚Äôs ok not to be ok</a>&nbsp;as we
  continue setting the world on fire. As we&nbsp;<a
    href="https://radical.foundation/2024/05/30/not-speed-and-scale-care-and-depth/">sacrifice care and depth for speed
    and scale</a>. As we ignore the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/sound-the-alarm-data-sonification-as-a-tool-for-climate-action/">sounds of
    alarm</a>. As life becomes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wewillbearwitness.org/p/the-garden-of-time">stranger than
    fiction</a>. It really is ok not to be ok.</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs also ok to take a step back when you need to. To&nbsp;<a
    href="https://atmos.earth/benefits-of-walking-and-thinking/">take a walk</a>, especially in nature, and truly think
  different. Not necessarily about solutions, but the big picture. The assumptions, the stories we take for granted. And
  perhaps get closer to embracing a&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2024-05-09/towards-planetarity/">planetary worldview</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Moonthly Meme</strong></h2>
<p>We wonder how often uncle Sam and his friends get the chance to walk in nature given the lack of (moral) imagination
  they display when it comes to imagining possible tech futures. We can‚Äôt take those walks for them, but instead we like
  to explore how we might use their AI creations to feed their imagination.</p>
<p>Recently, Alja decided to enlist ChatGPT‚Äôs help in&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ialja_responsibleai-sustainability-chatgpt-activity-7196169873033424896-Ph23">imagining

<h3>Join us for the Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</h3>
<p>In this lunation cycle, we‚Äôre inviting Pathfinders to gather around our virtual campfire to explore the
  question:&nbsp;<strong>How can we prompt biased AI assistants to help us think different and imagine diverse tech
    futures?</strong>&nbsp;‚Äì but it‚Äôs quite likely that our discussion will take other meandering turns as well.</p>

  üåï&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://lu.ma/jgzxt4ks">Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</a>&nbsp;on Friday, June 21 at 5PM
    AEST / 9AM CEST</strong>, when the moon will once again be illuminated by the sun.</p>
<p>This is a free and casual open discussion, but please be sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://lu.ma/jgzxt4ks">sign
    up</a>&nbsp;so that we can lug an appropriate number of logs around the virtual campfire. And yes, friends who don‚Äôt

<h3>Keep on finding paths on your own</h3>
<p>If you can‚Äôt make it to our Full Moon Pathfinding session, we still invite you to make your own! If anything emerges
  while reading this Newmoonsletter, write it down. You can keep these reflections for yourself or share them with
  others. If it feels right, find the Reply button ‚Äì or comment on this post ‚Äì and share your reflections with us. We‚Äôd
  love to feature Pathfinders reflections in upcoming Newmoonsletters and explore even more diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôve enjoyed this Newmoonsletter or perhaps even cracked a smile, we‚Äôd appreciate it if you shared it with
  your friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>The next Newmoonsletter will rise again during the next new moon. Until then, remember to refill your water flasks,
  take as many fully offline walks as you can, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you
  tell. There‚Äôs magic in both.</p>
