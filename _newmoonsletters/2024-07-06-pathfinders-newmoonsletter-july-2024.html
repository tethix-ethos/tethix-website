title: Pathfinders Newmoonsletter, July 2024
date: 2024-07-06
description: We try to escape the AI rat race by slowing down & playing with time. We listen for storms brewing in the distance while harvesting corn that might reveal diverse rainbow visions of our tech futures.
---

<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>With this Newmoonsletter, crafted around the Tethix campfire, we invite you to join other Pathfinders as we reflect
  on celestial movements in tech in the previous lunar cycle, water our ETHOS Gardens, and plant seeds of intentions for
  the new cycle that begins today.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Weather Report</strong></h2>
<p>üèúÔ∏è&nbsp;<strong>Current conditions: Is that lightning we see in the distance, or just a mirage in the AI
    desert?</strong></p>
<p>Remember when the fire practitioners of Silicon Valley said they wanted AI regulation? Meta and Apple sure don‚Äôt.
  They won‚Äôt let people in the EU play with their allegedly magical AI toys unless we allow them to keep building walls
  around the playground.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/21/apple-ai-europe-regulation">Apple delays launch
      of AI-powered features in Europe, blaming EU rules</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a

      European regulators are ruining its AI bot</a>)</em></p>
<p>It must be so hard for these fire practitioners to keep having to explain their genius to the ignorant masses. Why
  can‚Äôt we see that creatives shouldn‚Äôt have a job unless they can generate at least 2,880 derivative images every
  single day, without demanding worker rights? Great artists steal, and fire practitioners finally figured out a way to
  scale stealing, so they can free you of boring jobs that demand thinking and creativity! Why do we keep standing in
  the way of innovation with all these ethical concerns and regulations? Probably only because we cannot yet appreciate
  how grand their vision to&nbsp;<s>win the AI rat race</s>&nbsp;benefit humanity is.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

<p>And sure, you might be having some trouble getting a job because your resume isn‚Äôt AI optimized and your natural
  general intelligence is considered too expensive. The sooner you realize that all your manager needs you to do is
  speed up user research by outsourcing it to AI chatbots, the better off you‚Äôll be. And sure, AI chatbots are starting
  to sound a bit boring, but it‚Äôs speed and efficiency that we‚Äôre after! Take a page out of the gen AI book and just
  output the most statically probable result as fast as you can, and you‚Äôll be fine in this brave AI
  world.&nbsp;<em>(See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mindtheproduct.com/an-inside-look-at-the-product-job-market/">An inside

<p>While you‚Äôre stuck in the AI rat race, some fire practitioners apparently have no problem getting funding to build
  their own ivory tower in which they will be insulated from questioning peasants. There they‚Äôll be able to focus on the
  transmutation of deep learning matter until&nbsp;<em>safe</em>&nbsp;superintelligent AI golems emerge from their
  kilns.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

<p><a href="https://conversational-leadership.net/multipolar-trap/">Moloch</a>&nbsp;would again like to remind you not
  to question why and whether superintelligent AI golems are needed. After all, fire practitioners feel they have the
  once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build superintelligence in their own flawed likeness, and why wouldn‚Äôt you want to
  bet your children‚Äôs future on such a glorious goal? Why yes, Big Tech companies are now falling behind their carbon
  targets. But we should be grateful that they set such ambitious goals in the first place! And don‚Äôt worry about your
  children, they‚Äôve totally got Moloch under control, all they need is a miracle energy solution! We all just need to
  keep calm and believe in our lord and savior, infinite growth!&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

      exhausting the power grid. Tech firms are seeking a miracle solution</a>)</em></p>
<p>We‚Äôre not willing to place our bets on the promised superintelligent saviors, but we are curious whether we might
  enlist the help of current&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.404media.co/google-ai-potentially-breaking-reality-is-a-feature-not-a-bug/">unsafe
    regularintelligent AI golems</a>&nbsp;to help us think different about what‚Äôs possible, and perhaps even more
  importantly,&nbsp;<em>preferable</em>. In our latest&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/how-can-we-prompt-biased-ai-assistants">Pathfinders Podcast</a>&nbsp;we
  confirmed that thinking different and imagining diverse tech futures cannot yet be fully outsourced to AI assistants,
  but that ChatGPT can be computationally tickled to question Moloch‚Äôs business as usual.</p>
<p>We hope the seeds we collected for this Newmoonsletter manage to intellectually and emotionally tickle your curiosity
  and inspire you to seek more diverse paths, with or without AI assistance. It might be only a mirage, but we feel a
  storm brewing in our bones that might eventually bring much needed water to the AI desert. And with that, rainbow
  mirror visions that will finally reveal AI golems in their full complexity, without pretending that their
  environmental impacts and other shadows don‚Äôt exist.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Elemental seeds</strong></h2>
<h3 class="fire">Fire seeds to stoke your Practice</h3>
<p>While we keep waiting for more nuanced debates on AI, Apple has decided to enter the AI chat. Instead of introducing
  yet another chatbot, they took a slightly different path in which generative AI is used as a commodity technology,
  as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2024/06/20/apple-intelligence">Benedict Evens observes</a>.
  Apple‚Äôs AI models will be cleverly embedded in their existing services instead of pretending to be an all-knowing
  oracle. And they will try to rely on on-device processing more than on the cloud. We thought this was a move in the
  right direction to minimize the environmental impacts of generative AI, until we realized that Apple basically expects
  most of us to buy new iPhones to access this functionality.</p>
<p>Still, we are glad that companies are starting to think outside the chatbot. Like mmhmm (a presentation software),
  which attempts to bring out your own voice by using AI to generate&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.mmhmm.app/blog/questions-find-your-voice-with-mmhmm-s-ai-enhanced-interviewing-tool">contextual
    questions</a>&nbsp;while you present your ideas, instead of having AI write a script for you. In the recent&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/how-can-we-prompt-biased-ai-assistants">episode of our podcast</a>, we wonder
  whether asking better questions to help us think more deeply might be an underrated feature when it comes to AI
  assistants.</p>
<p>To explore how we might build AI with more integrity, Alja will participate in a&nbsp;<a
    href="https://web.storytell.ai/upcoming-events/building-ai-with-integrity">free webinar</a>&nbsp;on July 25 at 10 AM
  PT to discuss how we might approach AI development with more compassion, empathy, and wisdom.</p>
<p>Part of the answer certainly is in slowing down and resisting the modern urge to ‚Äú<a
    href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/make-it-more-ai-trend">make it more</a>‚Äù just because we can. For
  instance,&nbsp;<a href="https://mapperclub.substack.com/p/most-teams-build-too-many-features">this use
    case</a>&nbsp;by Christoph Steinlehner shows how a tool like journey mapping can be used to discover how to build
  simpler features instead of overbuilding. The Wizard Jason Fox explores how to escape the Moloch trap of productivity
  with a bit of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxwizard.com/wizard-productive/">magic and five mythic modes</a>&nbsp;that
  balance the use of your life mana. And Alja has been pondering how you can think further outside the box by&nbsp;<a
    href="https://blog.ialja.com/2024/07/02/thinking-outside-the-present-product-design/">thinking outside the
    present</a>&nbsp;and playing with different time perspectives.</p>
<p>Slowing down doesn‚Äôt mean just doing fewer things, but taking the time to do fewer things well. If you need a
  reminder of why doing less shouldn‚Äôt be rushed, look no further than the trend of&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/13/1093375/gamification-behaviorism-npcs-video-games/">gamification</a>.
  While not a bad idea on its own, it sadly inspired people to cherry-pick game mechanics in pursuit of greater
  engagement without bothering to understand what makes good games fun. And without doing the slow, deep work of good
  game design.</p>
<h3 class="air">Air seeds to improve the flow of Collaboration</h3>
<p>If you work in tech, it‚Äôs easy to feel like you‚Äôve got no choice but to sprint along the latest trends, whether it‚Äôs
  gamification or generative AI. As an individual, it sure can be hard to challenge and change the system we operate in.
  But there‚Äôs strength in numbers and in community, as the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2024-06-11/community-powered-change/">SCI (System Community Individual)
    change model</a>&nbsp;reminds us. We also invite you to join the Holistic Technology + Wise Innovation&nbsp;<a
    href="https://discord.gg/hGwtt9sPqh">Discord server</a>&nbsp;hosted by the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://wiseinnovation.school/">Wise Innovation Project</a>&nbsp;if you‚Äôre looking for a space and community
  where you can discuss different approaches to building technology.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôre battling with feelings of inadequacy in a world of artificial intelligence, let the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.sciencealert.com/swiss-startup-connects-16-human-mini-brains-to-create-low-energy-biocomputer">news</a>&nbsp;on
  powerful and energy-efficient biocomputers based on lab-grown human brain cells remind you there‚Äôs magic in our
  wetware after all. Sure, the ethics of brains-in-the-cloud is bound to be even stickier ‚Äì both literally and
  figuratively ‚Äì than the ethics of artificial neuronal networks.</p>
<p>For now, we take solace in reminding ourselves that while we might not be as fast as ChatGPT, each of us is an
  awe-inspiring collection not just of neurons, but a full embodied container of wisdom. And this container doesn‚Äôt just
  allow us to summarize PDF reports (though we can be taught and persuaded to do so), but to collaborate with each other
  and the rest of the natural world in ways no machine intelligence can.</p>
<h3 class="earth">Earth seeds to ground you in Research</h3>
<p>Speaking of collaboration,&nbsp;<a href="https://mcgovern.mit.edu/2024/06/19/what-is-language-for/">fascinating new
    research</a>&nbsp;makes the case that language is a tool for communication rather than thought. While we might use
  language for thinking, we have the remarkable capability to do all sorts of thinking without language. If this is
  true, do we expect too much of LLMs (Large&nbsp;<em>Language</em>&nbsp;Models) when we‚Äôre asking them to think?
  Perhaps LLMs are great at using language exactly for its intended purpose of communicating. Which is what also makes
  them dangerously persuasive, even when they suggest adding glue to your pizza.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs clear that language is a powerful way for transmitting knowledge, and now LLMs are able to transmit ‚Äì
  and&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.404media.co/google-ai-potentially-breaking-reality-is-a-feature-not-a-bug/">manipulate</a>&nbsp;‚Äì
  knowledge and biases scraped off the internet at a scale we never thought possible. LLMs reflect our humanity, but we
  tend to focus on limited reflections of either dystopias ‚Äì dark mirrors, explored in the Netflix series Black Mirror ‚Äì
  or utopias ‚Äì the techno-optimist bright mirrors ‚Äì that match our worldview. We need to collectively make the effort to
  seek rainbow mirror visions that can show us more diverse, pluralistic visions of the future. This is a topic we
  explore in&nbsp;<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568172">Rainbow Mirrors: Technology and Our Collective
    Moral Imagination</a>, an article published in the latest issue of the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10568157&amp;punumber=44">IEEE Technology and Society

<p>If you want to explore rainbow mirrors further, we invite you to check out our blog post on the&nbsp;<a

    href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-KPz9WDVIB-rainbow-mirrors-gpt">Rainbow Mirrors GPT</a>.</p>
<p>Rainbow mirrors remind us of the importance of questioning established narratives and responses we have to emerging
  technologies, such as generative AI. Benjamin Bratton explores this beautifully in the essay&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.noemamag.com/the-five-stages-of-ai-grief/">The Five Stages Of AI Grief</a>.</p>
<h3 class="water">Water seeds to deepen your Reflection</h3>
<p>Of course, exploring rainbow mirrors and questioning narratives requires time. Not just ‚Äúchronos‚Äù ‚Äì linear time ‚Äì,
  but ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos">kairos</a>‚Äù ‚Äì qualitative time that isn‚Äôt measured or defined by
  the clock. Time both for being present and for expanding our time horizons in all directions. Time to rethink our
  relationship with time itself.<br></p>
<p>It‚Äôs hard to find that&nbsp;<em>kairos</em>&nbsp;time when notifications and deadlines keep us chained to our screens
  and addicted to constant stimuli to the point where&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1250830">most people</a>&nbsp;would rather receive electrical
  shocks than sit alone with their thoughts. In a&nbsp;<a
    href="https://psyche.co/ideas/do-you-find-the-21st-century-overstimulating-try-longstorming">recent essay</a>,
  Vincent Ialenti invites us to try ‚Äúlongstorming‚Äù by taking the time to explore outdoor spaces and
  face&nbsp;<em>‚Äúsublime geophysical and ecological environments‚Äù&nbsp;</em>that<em>&nbsp;‚Äúcan invite the mind to
    brainstorm about our long-term futures and past‚Äù</em>.</p>
<p>While you‚Äôre out and about with storms in your mind, don‚Äôt forget that our obsession with growing&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/humans-have-exceeded-six-of-the-nine-boundaries-keeping-earth-habitable-180982909/">beyond
    planetary boundaries</a>&nbsp;is making actual&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/09/1147805696/climate-change-makes-heat-waves-storms-and-droughts-worse-climate-report-confirm">storms
    more extreme</a>, so be sure to update your&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/hiking-and-backpacking/lightning-safety-facts-hikers/">lightning
    safety</a>&nbsp;training data and respect the power of storms.</p>
<p>And just like lightning helps to fertilize soil during storms, your imagination can be fertilized when you make time
  for creative lightning to strike. Metaphors and stories can provide powerful sparks for creative storms. In this
  lunation, we were particularly inspired by the exercise developed by Vanessa de Oliveira Andreotti to challenge our
  views of what‚Äôs possible and valued in modernity. The exercise, presented in her book&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/675703/hospicing-modernity-by-vanessa-machado-de-oliveira/">Hospicing
    Modernity</a>, invites participants&nbsp;<em>‚Äúto imagine a field of corn, and to harvest and display the corn on the
    ground‚Äù</em>.</p>
<p>Go on. Have a go at imagining the harvested corn before you scroll down. Do your harvested corncobs look like this
  emoji üåΩ, with yellow kernels? (That‚Äôs certainly what image-generating AI tools suggest.)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You probably didn‚Äôt imagine something like this:</p>
<a href="https://www.ruralsprout.com/glass-gem-corn/"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/glass-gem-corn-3.webp" alt="Dozens of harvested corncobs with multicolored kernels are laid out on a flat surface."></a>
<p>Yes, rainbow corn ‚Äì or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ruralsprout.com/glass-gem-corn/">glass gem corn</a>&nbsp;‚Äì is a
  thing, even though modernity likes to tell the single story of yellow corn that limits our imagination of what‚Äôs
  possible and desirable. (If you want to dig deeper into this metaphor, we recommend exploring it fully in the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/675703/hospicing-modernity-by-vanessa-machado-de-oliveira/">book</a>.
  Or you can start by listening to Vanessa talk about her work on&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5kQ7_IZ8YI">The Great Simplification podcast</a>.)</p>
<p>We hope the images of rainbow corn help you reflect on your current limits of imagination and challenge simplistic
  stories of what‚Äôs possible and inevitable. We invite you to take the time to slow down, pop some rainbow corn ‚Äì real
  or imagined ‚Äì and share it with friends as you collectively explore more diverse, rainbow mirror visions of what‚Äôs
  both possible and preferable for the benefit of humanity&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;other life on this wonderfully diverse
  planet.</p>
<h3>A music seed to sing &amp; dance along</h3>
<p>Slowing down doesn‚Äôt just mean stillness. It also means remembering to breathe and move through song and dance. When
  was the last time you took some time to sing your heart out or dance like nobody‚Äôs watching?</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt believe the hype,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TLgaue4yhs">time is on your side</a>.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TLgaue4yhs"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3TLgaue4yhs-HQ.jpg" alt="YouTube thumbnail cover from an album."></a>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>‚Ä¶<br>Time is on your side</em><br><em>No more need in runnin'</em><br><em>No more need to hide</em><br><em>No

<h2><strong>Tethix Moonthly Meme</strong></h2>
<p>Oh, and happy&nbsp;<em>Juluary</em>&nbsp;from Excel's Copilot!</p>
<img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/excel-copilot.png" width="351" alt="Screenshot showing Excel autocompleting month names as Maruary, Apruary, etc.">
<p>Just kidding. We recently noticed this image making the rounds (and harvesting engagement) on LinkedIn. While
  entertaining, the image recycles an old meme, dating back to pre-gen AI times when we had to generate our own memes in
  Photoshop. And Microsoft‚Äôs Copilot is now being credited ‚Äì or blamed ‚Äì with undue creativity.</p>
<p>We decided to ask ChatGPT whether this meme appears to be the neuralwork of Copilot. ChatGPT expressed its doubts,
  coming in defense of its AI sibling by saying:&nbsp;<em>‚ÄúThe AI model used by Copilot would generally suggest correct
    and contextually appropriate content.‚Äù</em>&nbsp;So there you go, in addition to generating misinformation,
  generative AI can also help you think critically about stuff you find online!</p>
<p>In the words of ChatGPTo (and countless humans the model was trained on):&nbsp;<em>‚ÄúMemes often playfully distort
    reality, and it's important to critically analyze claims, especially those involving new technologies like Microsoft
    Copilot. If you have any more questions or need further analysis, feel free to ask!‚Äù</em>&nbsp;Let this be a
  reminder to never stop questioning the lunacy of tech.</p>

  lunation cycle, and the paths illuminated during the Full Moon Gathering.</p>
<p>The question that emerged in the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/pathfinders-newmoonsletter-june-2024">June Newmoonsletter</a>&nbsp;and guided
  our discussion is:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/how-can-we-prompt-biased-ai-assistants">How can
      we prompt biased AI assistants to help us think different and imagine diverse tech futures?</a>&nbsp;</strong>In
  this episode, we wonder how we might collectively go beyond prompt engineering that‚Äôs focused on productivity and
  getting answers ‚Äì fast! ‚Äì to prompting diverse ways of knowing and being, while remaining mindful of current AI biases
  and limitations.</p>
<p>We reflect on our experiments with woo prompting and custom instructions, and share our observations on the power of
  conversational learning and language. We also reflect on what we learned from having chatbots chat with each other,
  what makes ChatGPT computationally tickled, and why we think AI assistants should get better at asking
  thought-provoking questions, rather than rushing to answers and people pleasing. We also ponder on the time component
  of our conversations and how both humans and machines might benefit from having more time to engage in slower, systems
  2 thinking to collaboratively explore our biases and assumptions instead of jumping to quick solutions.</p>

<h2><strong>Your turn, Pathfinders.</strong></h2>
<h3>Join us for the Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</h3>
<p>In this lunation cycle, we‚Äôre inviting Pathfinders to gather around our virtual campfire to explore the
  question:&nbsp;<strong>What should we do with the time that new technologies save?</strong>&nbsp;‚Äì but it‚Äôs quite
  likely that our discussion will take other meandering turns as well.</p>
<a href="https://lu.ma/wqi04s08"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pathfinders-full-moon-gathering_2024-07-22.png" class="full-moon-card" alt=""></a>
<p>So, pack your curiosity, moral imagination, and smiles, and join us around the virtual campfire for our next
  üåï&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://lu.ma/wqi04s08">Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</a>&nbsp;on Monday, July 22 at 5PM
    AEST / 9AM CEST</strong>, when the moon will once again be illuminated by the sun.</p>
<p>This is a free and casual open discussion, but please be sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://lu.ma/wqi04s08">sign
    up</a>&nbsp;so that we can lug an appropriate number of logs around the virtual campfire. And yes, friends who don‚Äôt
  have the attention span for the Newmoonsletter are also welcome, as long as they reserve their&nbsp;<a
    href="https://lu.ma/wqi04s08">seat on the logs</a>.</p>
<h3>Keep on finding paths on your own</h3>
<p>If you can‚Äôt make it to our Full Moon Pathfinding session, we still invite you to make your own! If anything emerges
  while reading this Newmoonsletter, write it down. You can keep these reflections for yourself or share them with
  others. If it feels right, find the Reply button ‚Äì or comment on this post ‚Äì and share your reflections with us. We‚Äôd
  love to feature Pathfinders reflections in upcoming Newmoonsletters and explore even more diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôve enjoyed this Newmoonsletter or perhaps even cracked a smile, we‚Äôd appreciate it if you shared it with
  your friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>The next Newmoonsletter will rise again during the next new moon. Until then, pop some rainbow corn, take the time to
  sing &amp; dance with your loved ones, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell.
  There‚Äôs magic in both.</p>
