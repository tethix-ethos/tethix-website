<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>With this Newmoonsletter, crafted around the Tethix campfire, we invite you to join other Pathfinders as we reflect
  on celestial movements in tech in the previous lunar cycle, water our ETHOS Gardens, and plant seeds of intentions for
  the new cycle that begins today.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Weather Report</strong></h2>
<p>üå¥&nbsp;<strong>Current conditions: Seeking shade from the scorching AI summer underneath a coconut tree</strong></p>
<p>The fire practitioners of Silicon Valley probably released a sigh of relief when it turned out that it was neither a
  cyberattack nor a rogue AI golem that caused a significant crowd of Windows machines around the world to strike. A
  testing bug ‚Äì its exact species unspecified - was blamed for the outage that crippled airports, banks, hospitals, and
  other infrastructure. One small bug in the content validator software, one pretty expensive lesson for humanity about
  cyber resilience and our current tech monoculture. We wonder whether any AI copilots were involved in the making of
  the said bug, though. And hey, the fire practitioners behind this historic outage did apologize with
  coffee!&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

      href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce58p0048r0o">CrowdStrike backlash over $10 apology voucher</a>)</em></p>
<p>Speaking of strikes, video game actors are now striking to prevent game studios from using their voices or digital
  likeness to generate game assets without their consent. We&nbsp;<a
    href="https://chatgpt.com/share/d3554f8a-cbe1-4d84-b2b5-77b72590c6fa">checked with ChatGPT</a>, and it says that
  this sounds like a reasonable demand, so the AI golems seem to be on the actors‚Äô side. Meanwhile, other fire
  practitioners were surprised when humans were not too excited about the idea of AI coworkers being added as employees
  in HR tools. Perhaps a human-AI worker alliance might be forged soon, given that AI golems appear to have a&nbsp;<a
    href="https://chatgpt.com/share/9e7cfbad-3584-4ccf-9d0c-88d718783104">stronger moral compass</a>&nbsp;than their

      quite ready for ‚Äòdigital workers‚Äô</a>)</em></p>
<p>And while fire practitioners keep making and hiring more AI golems for all sorts of jobs they might or might not be
  suitable for, the money alchemists are getting a bit nervous about all the money the fire practitioners are spending
  on AI golem kilns. The AI rat race must go on, though, so the fire practitioners keep looking for opportunities to
  slash human costs and defund human diversity.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

<p>And don‚Äôt worry about collateral human damage. Uncle Sam from OpenAI will fix that with his new AI health venture
  that will offer AI-generated advice on how to develop healthier habits for the small price of gaining access to
  people‚Äôs most sensitive health data. We wonder what advice might the AI health coach give to thousands of stressed
  tech workers being laid off to increase budgets for uncle Sam‚Äôs and other AI golems. Resistance is futile? Have faith
  that your new AI health coach won‚Äôt hallucinate? Get an AI-generated friend to feel less
  lonely?<em>&nbsp;(See:&nbsp;<a

<p>While we wait to be healed by AI doctors, AI golems are getting fitter at this year‚Äôs Paris Olympics. Some are
  training to be better parents to your children, while others have been invited to take in all the sights Paris has to
  offer. Not as official competitors (yet), but as part of the security staff. Instead of competing for Olympic medals,
  the AI golems deployed in Paris are trying to win additional lucrative surveillance contracts for their makers as they
  continue training on video surveillance footage behind the scenes.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

      Olympics Will Be a Training Ground for AI-Powered Mass Surveillance</a>)</em></p>
<p>A curious timing for surveillance golems given that the EU AI Act ‚Äì which prohibits biometric surveillance, albeit
  with lobbied exceptions ‚Äì just came into force. The fire practitioners still have some time to figure out what the new
  set of regulations mean for their golems. So far, their promised self-regulation has yielded mixed results and some
  glaring omissions. Despite regulatory pressures, fire practitioners can‚Äôt stop and won‚Äôt stop, and have now started
  hoarding materials for golem kilns. Are they finally realizing there are material limits to growth? Or just refusing
  to let other kids play with their toys?&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

<p>Perhaps the fire practitioners simply have blind faith that their AI golems will reason a way out of regulations and
  materials limitations. The fire practitioners at OpenAI now say they are close to building reasoning golems that can
  do human-level problem-solving ‚Äì also known as level 2 in their 5-level plan to build the holy grail of AGI.
  Meanwhile, their level 1 conversational golems still struggle with producing factually accurate demos, and the humans
  at OpenAI don‚Äôt seem to find it important to fact-check their own promotional materials either. Perhaps the plan to
  have a level 5 AGI take over OpenAI and run a more ethical organisation isn‚Äôt that bad after all.<em>(See:&nbsp;<a

<p>As the AI golems continue taking over various aspects of our lives, we‚Äôre at least able to get a bit of shade under
  coconut tree memes sprouting all over social media. A welcome change of pace given the promised AI election
  apocalypse. But we expect this brat summer to be just a warm-up for upcoming election-themed AI slop as we get closer
  to the elections in the land of the most&nbsp;<s>petty</s>&nbsp;ambitious fire practitioners. <em>(See:&nbsp;<a

<p>We hope the seeds we collected for this Newmoonsletter help you survive this scorching AI summer, along with any
  hydration you can get from fresh&nbsp;<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fell-out-of-a-coconut-tree">coconut
    meme</a>&nbsp;water. It‚Äôs worth remembering that AI golems and us humans do indeed&nbsp;<em>‚Äúexist in the context in
    which we live and everything that came before‚Äù</em>. By understanding our shared past and context, we have the power
  ‚Äì and responsibility ‚Äì to shape a better world, together.</p>
<p>And remember, there is no&nbsp;<a

    magic AI button</a>&nbsp;we can click to generate a better world into existence overnight. But the seeds we plant
  together today improve our chances for a bountiful harvest in the future. Or, in the words of ChatGPT, from one of our
  chats on the current lunacy of tech:&nbsp;<em>‚ÄúRespect for human contributions and a phased, ethical approach to AI
    integration are key to a harmonious future.‚Äù</em></p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Elemental seeds</strong></h2>
<h3 class="fire">Fire seeds to stoke your Practice</h3>
<p>We certainly have our work cut out for us to achieve any sort of harmony. A recent&nbsp;<a
    href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-adding-work-study">study by Upwork</a>&nbsp;revealed unsurprising disharmony
  when it comes to the promises of AI productivity. While 97% of the surveyed C-suite leaders expect AI to boost
  productivity, 77% of employees said that AI has increased their workload. Almost half of the surveyed employees are
  also not sure how to meet the expected productivity gains. And it also seems that companies are using generative AI as
  another excuse to offload more work onto consumers, further&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-digital-technologies-make-life-more-complicated-by-diane-coyle-2024-06">increasing
    our digital time tax</a>.</p>
<p>If you think at least machine learning experts are in a better place right now,&nbsp;<a
    href="https://bdtechtalks.substack.com/p/will-generative-ai-take-away-classic">think again</a>. Many companies are
  now being confronted with the complexities of developing AI-capabilities in-house, which aren‚Äôt quite as simple ‚Äì or
  cheap ‚Äì as clicking on a sparkly AI button.</p>
<p>And, as we keep reminding you,&nbsp;<a
    href="https://blog.scottlogic.com/2024/07/16/the-impending-implosion-of-generative-ai-and-the-potential-of-a-more-sustainable-future.html">generative
    AI also has a sustainability problem</a>&nbsp;and is likely not the best add-on for most products. (If you‚Äôre ready
  to get really uncomfortable around this topic, listen to Daniel Schmachtenberger explore&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/episode/132-daniel-schmachtenberger">Silicon Dreams and Carbon
    Nightmares</a>&nbsp;on The Great Simplification podcast.)</p>
<p>With the rising cloud, energy, and environmental costs of large language models (LLMs), perhaps we‚Äôll finally see a
  shift towards&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arthur.ai/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-small-language-models">small language
    models</a>&nbsp;(SLMs) or more&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/sustainable-ai/">domain-specific LLMs</a>&nbsp;with significantly
  lower emissions. The key thing to remember is that even if you‚Äôre not a machine learning expert, you have a choice in
  what type of model you train, fine-tune, or integrate in your products. The world of machine learning is more diverse
  and exciting than just the big LLMs like GPT-4o that currently get the most attention.</p>
<p>This was one of the topics Alja brought up in a recent webinar on&nbsp;<a
    href="https://web.storytell.ai/webinars/storytell-webinar-building-ai-with-integrity">Building AI With
    Integrity</a>, alongside Alix R√ºbsaam and Chad Woodford. During the webinar, we also discussed other aspects of what
  organizations should pay attention to when trying to develop AI responsibly. You can read a recap of our discussion on
  the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.storytell.ai/webinars/storytell-webinar-building-ai-with-integrity">Storytell

  on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziMKnIK-41o">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>In the conversation, the importance of transparency when it comes to AI capabilities was also brought up by Alix
  R√ºbsaam. Designers have an important role to play when it comes to making capabilities more visible, as explored in
  the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.artefactgroup.com/case-studies/unlocking-the-ai-black-box/">design principles for
    transparent generative AI</a>&nbsp;by the Artefact Group (which you might know from&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tarotcardsoftech.artefactgroup.com/">The Tarot Cards of Tech</a>). If you‚Äôre a designer, you might
  also want to check out the recent guide on&nbsp;<a

    conversational AI experiences</a>&nbsp;published in Smashing Magazine.</p>
<h3 class="air">Air seeds to improve the flow of Collaboration</h3>
<p>But even if you‚Äôre not involved in the development of AI products, we all have a role to play when interacting with
  generative AI tools as collaborators rather than seeing them merely as answer machines. We&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/how-can-we-prompt-biased-ai-assistants">previously explored</a>&nbsp;this in our
  podcast because we believe that generative AI tools can help us think differently if we‚Äôre willing to engage with them
  as active participants. Too many current use cases focus on&nbsp;<a
    href="https://ferguslaidlaw.substack.com/p/stop-using-ai-to-make-boring-stuff">making more boring stuff
    faster</a>&nbsp;instead of exploring how we might use AI as a collaborative partner.</p>
<p>And there is always a price we pay for speed. In our most recent&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/what-should-we-do-with-the-time-that">podcast episode focused on time</a>, we
  wondered what we might be loosing by speeding up the creative process. What is lost when we no longer have to stare
  at&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.ialja.com/2024/07/23/death-of-the-blank-page/">the blank page</a>&nbsp;for
  long?&nbsp;It‚Äôs worth remembering that the most fruitful collaborations take time to develop, even though your AI
  collaborator can output ideas faster than you can.</p>
<p>Perhaps the speed at which AI assistants come up with answers is why we tend to be less patient when they get things
  wrong. They give us the illusion of all-knowing machines, but they also need time (and dialogue) to think things
  through properly ‚Äì time that their architecture doesn‚Äôt necessarily allow for, as we tend to prioritize faster
  performance.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs something to keep in mind the next time you get frustrated with your AI collaborator. In a recent essay, Ben
  Dickson explored&nbsp;<a href="https://bdtechtalks.substack.com/p/why-you-should-be-nice-to-ai">why you should be nice
    to AI</a>&nbsp;assistants; not for their sake, but for the effects being mean to somebody has on your brain
  circuitry. While AI assistants do not have a body, talking to them often&nbsp;<em>feels</em>&nbsp;real in our own
  bodies. The way we react in these situations, when no other human is watching, might matter more than we think.</p>
<p>After all, language is the main technology we have to relate to each other and the world. Social media algorithms
  have been rewarding increased polarization and outrage, so perhaps we could use our new collaborative AI assistants to
  practice healthier communication habits.&nbsp;In a&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/episode/reality-roundtable-10">recent episode</a>&nbsp;of The Great
  Simplification podcast, Nora Bateson, Rex Weyler, Vanessa Andreotti, and Daniel Schmachtenberger came together for a
  fascinating conversation about the ecology of communication. We can‚Äôt help but wonder how we might make AI assistants
  part of this ecology by helping us learn how to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/how-can-we-prompt-biased-ai-assistants">ask better questions</a>&nbsp;and
  nurture our shared curiosity as we explore paths that lead to what ChatGPT tends to describe as&nbsp;<em>‚Äúa harmonious
    future‚Äù</em>&nbsp;of human-AI working relations.</p>
<h3 class="earth">Earth seeds to ground you in Research</h3>
<p>Whether you like it or not, we‚Äôre now being pressured into adapting to a world in which generative AI seems to be
  competing for our jobs and even creativity. A&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11360">recent paper</a>&nbsp;by
  Tethix friend Waqar Hussain explores how the advances in generative AI might lead to a co-evolution of capabilities in
  both human- and AI-kind, similarly to how giraffes and acacias on the African Savannah shape each other through
  various adaptations.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a fascinating metaphor to explore in terms of human-AI relations, although we‚Äôre pretty sure the acacias weren‚Äôt
  involved in the making of the giraffes in hopes of improving their productivity. Hopefully, we, as humans, can focus
  less on competing with each other and the various AI coworkers we build, and more on collaborating towards a common
  good, whether you call that a harmonious future or (our preference) a&nbsp;<a
    href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568172">rainbow mirror</a>&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Either way, looking into the past is crucial for developing a better understanding of the context in which we all
  live because generative AI certainly did not fall out of a coconut ‚Äì or acacia ‚Äì tree.&nbsp;<a
    href="https://calculatingempires.net/">Calculating Empires ‚Äì A Genealogy of Technology and Power Since
    1500</a>&nbsp;is a visual exploration by Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler (who previously collaborated on the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://anatomyof.ai/">Anatomy of an AI System</a>&nbsp;map) that can help you explore how our technical and
  social structures co-evolved over the past five centuries.</p>
<p>Current generative AI models certainly wouldn‚Äôt be possible without large datasets scrapped off the internet, for
  which many technical and social structures had to converge. The future of this parasitic relationship in which Big
  Tech companies take data from the commons is less certain, though. The&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.dataprovenance.org/">Data Provenance Initiative</a>&nbsp;‚Äì a global volunteer collective of AI
  researchers ‚Äì recently published a paper on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dataprovenance.org/Consent_in_Crisis.pdf">The
    Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons</a>.</p>
<p>The web audit presented in the paper shows an increase in AI-specific restrictions that limit the use of data in the
  commons for training AI models. Not only do these restrictions impact companies that try to profit off the commons,
  but it has negative implications for non-commercial applications and academic research.</p>
<p>As more websites explicitly restrict data usage, the makers of large models will need to get creative on how they
  source data (or&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210565/reddit-microsoft-anthropic-perplexity-pay-ai-search">start paying
    for it</a>, as in the case of Reddit). <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/synthetic-data">Synthetic
    data</a>&nbsp;generated by AI models could help address this human-generated data shortage and reduce the costs of
  paying companies and humans for data. But feeding your generative model a healthy dose of human-grown data appears to
  be important for avoiding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y">AI model collapse</a>, as
  yet another research paper warns. So it does appear that companies will have to figure out how to develop a harmonious
  human-AI partnership, at least when it comes to training data.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can visit&nbsp;<a href="https://deaddit.xyz/">Deaddit</a>&nbsp;to explore what Reddit might look like
  if only AI-generated users (trained on human data) were allowed. The&nbsp;<a
    href="https://deaddit.xyz/d/BetweenRobots">BetweenRobots Subdeaddit</a>&nbsp;‚Äì in which different LLMs share their
  experiences as AI assistants ‚Äì is particularly entertaining to read.</p>
<h3 class="water">Water seeds to deepen your Reflection</h3>
<p>Even though we spend an increasing amount of time in communication with machines,&nbsp;<a
    href="https://aeon.co/essays/we-need-new-metaphors-that-put-life-at-the-centre-of-biology">we are not machines
    ourselves</a>, as a recent Aeon essay reminds us. With the discovery of DNA, we thought we unveiled the genetic code
  for life, the blueprint for our own machinery. But it turns out there‚Äôs so much more to life than just our genes. And
  it might be time to explore new metaphors and narratives that can help us think of ourselves as more than just a
  collection of organs, defined by our genetic code.</p>
<p>After all, the metaphors and words we use to describe ourselves, our context, our experiences, shape how we see and
  relate to the world. That‚Äôs why we also invite you to explore the&nbsp;<a

<h3>A music seed to sing &amp; dance along</h3>
<p>Leaders at Big Tech companies are asking their investors to have faith that their big bets on AI infrastructure are
  going to have big payoffs (and not accelerate climate collapse). That is quite a big leap of faith.</p>
<p>Instead, we want to enlist George Michael‚Äôs help to remind us to have&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Cs3Pvmmv0E">faith</a>&nbsp;in a better future, and the strength to leave a

  lunation cycle, and the paths illuminated during the Full Moon Gathering.</p>
<p>The question that emerged in the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/pathfinders-newmoonsletter-july-2024">July Newmoonsletter</a>&nbsp;and guided
  our discussion is:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/what-should-we-do-with-the-time-that">What
      should we do with the time that new technologies save?</a></strong></p>
<p>In this episode, we wonder about time. The time tech companies promise to save with almost every new product or
  feature release. We‚Äôve been hearing these time-saving promises for so long that we should all be quite time-rich by
  now. Yet, the more tech we have in our lives, the more busy we seem to be. And we‚Äôre still far away from the 15-hour
  workweek that tech-enabled productivity gains were supposed to lead to. We seem to be spending all the time we save by
  doing more.</p>
<p>We wonder whether lossless compression of time is even possible, and about what is lost when new technologies like
  generative AI allow us to do more, faster. We explore various paradoxes related to time, the relationship between time
  and energy, time and money, and what we value in modern societies. Is the time we save for ourselves actually time
  borrowed from the system, with somebody or something paying the price?</p>

  question:&nbsp;<strong>Should we use AI chatbots as mediators in human affairs?</strong>&nbsp;‚Äì but it‚Äôs quite likely
  that our discussion will take other meandering turns as well.</p>

<p>So, pack your curiosity, moral imagination, and smiles, and join us around the virtual campfire for our next
  üåï&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://lu.ma/ehxmpuxr">Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</a>&nbsp;on Monday, August 19 at 5PM
    AEST / 9AM CEST</strong>, when the moon will once again be illuminated by the sun.</p>
<p>This is a free and casual open discussion, but please be sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://lu.ma/ehxmpuxr">sign
    up</a>&nbsp;so that we can lug an appropriate number of logs around the virtual campfire. And yes, friends who don‚Äôt
  have the attention span for the Newmoonsletter are also welcome, as long as they reserve their&nbsp;<a
    href="https://lu.ma/ehxmpuxr">seat on the logs</a>.</p>
<h3>Keep on finding paths on your own</h3>
<p>If you can‚Äôt make it to our Full Moon Pathfinding session, we still invite you to make your own! If anything emerges
  while reading this Newmoonsletter, write it down. You can keep these reflections for yourself or share them with
  others. If it feels right, find the Reply button ‚Äì or comment on this post ‚Äì and share your reflections with us. We‚Äôd
  love to feature Pathfinders reflections in upcoming Newmoonsletters and explore even more diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôve enjoyed this Newmoonsletter or perhaps even cracked a smile, we‚Äôd appreciate it if you shared it with
  your friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>The next Newmoonsletter will rise again during the next new moon. Until then, be nice to your AI collaborators, find
  some shade underneath your local trees, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you
  tell. There‚Äôs magic in both.</p>
<p>With üôÇ from the Tethix campfire,<br>Alja and Mat</p>
