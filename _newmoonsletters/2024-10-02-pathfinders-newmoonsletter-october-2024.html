title: Pathfinders Newmoonsletter, October 2024
date: 2024-10-02
description: This new moon, we try to reason with strawberries, look for human and AI companions for our fellowship, and try out tools that might just help us find paths that lead to preferable futures.
---

<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>With this Newmoonsletter, crafted around the Tethix campfire, we invite you to join other Pathfinders as we reflect
  on celestial movements in tech in the previous lunar cycle, water our ETHOS Gardens, and plant seeds of intentions for
  the new cycle that begins today.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Weather Report</strong></h2>
<p><strong>üçì Current conditions: Beware of fire practitioners trying to distract us with strawberries, red as our
    planet‚Äôs vital signs</strong></p>
<p>As OpenAI's new AI golems finally learn how to count 'r's in the word strawberry, the company‚Äôs chief fire
  practitioner Sam Altman promises us more future AI magic, such as fixing climate and establishing a space colony. And
  why shouldn‚Äôt we trust the vision and leadership skills of the fire practitioner who inspired 9 executives to quit his
  company in the past 9 months?&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://futureofbeinghuman.com/p/openai-o1-strawberry-moral-reasoning">OpenAI's new ‚Äúchain of thought‚Äù model
      is designed to reason like a human. How does it cope with a moral dilemma?</a>,&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/28/1104588/sorry-ai-wont-fix-climate-change/">Sorry, AI won‚Äôt ‚Äúfix‚Äù
      climate change</a>, and&nbsp;<a

      Business Is Tearing It Apart</a>)</em></p>
<p>We are definitely sensing a swelling in the cognitive dissonance field in Silicon Valley. Take for instance
  Microsoft, the Big Tech giant with a pledge to be carbon negative by 2030. The same Microsoft whose greenhouse gas
  emissions grew by&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157496/microsoft-ai-carbon-footprint-greenhouse-gas-emissions-grow-climate-pledge">30%
    last year</a>&nbsp;as the company also tries to win the AI race. And the same Microsoft that is selling AI as a way
  to extract more fossil fuels.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/09/microsoft-ai-oil-contracts/679804/">Microsoft‚Äôs
      Hypocrisy on AI</a>)</em></p>
<p>We admit we‚Äôre not fluent in this dialect of techno-optimist doublethink. Perhaps it‚Äôs our lack of a backup doomsday
  bunker that is making it challenging to see how placing all our eggs in one AI magic basket ‚Äì while continuing
  business as usual ‚Äì could lead to a flourishing future for humanity. Especially as more of our planet‚Äôs vital signs
  are flashing red.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://news.mongabay.com/2024/09/inaugural-planetary-health-check-finds-ocean-acidification-on-the-brink/">Inaugural
      Planetary Health Check finds ocean acidification on the brink</a>)</em></p>
<p>So we decided to put the advanced reasoning skills of ChatGPT-o1 to the test. The strawberry-flavored golem&nbsp;<a
    href="https://chatgpt.com/share/66fac4d3-1678-8004-86dd-e67d4ce9f664">reasons</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>‚Äútrusting that
    AI will ‚Äúsomehow‚Äù fix the climate without addressing underlying systemic issues may be overly optimistic‚Äù</em>, and
  that&nbsp;<em>‚Äúrelying on (AI) as a singular solution is insufficient‚Äù.</em></p>
<p>ChatGPT-o1 also&nbsp;<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/66fac4d3-1678-8004-86dd-e67d4ce9f664">appears</a>&nbsp;quite
  capable (and willing) of advising Sam Altman on concrete actions he might take to actually increase the positive
  impact AI could have on climate. Given the dwindling numbers of leaders at OpenAI, it might be time for this Sam to
  drink his own AI magic potion and heed ChatGPT‚Äôs advice. That is, if he actually is serious about finding (and
  funding) AI‚Äôs magical abilities to ‚Äúfix climate‚Äù and not just painting a&nbsp;<a
    href="https://ethos.tethix.co/mirrors/bright/">bright mirror</a>&nbsp;to woo investors.</p>
<p>If at any point in this Newmoonsletter you start feeling like the cognitive dissonance field is getting too strong,
  we‚Äôd like to remind you that a fellowship can go far even in what seems like a hopeless situation. In the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/how-do-we-embrace-the-lunacy-of-tech">latest episode</a>&nbsp;of Pathfinders
  Podcast, we travel to Middle-earth with Frodo, Gandalf, and a very different Sam to look for active hope and
  playfulness in our stories. Perhaps the fellowship that ends up defeating our own Sarumans and Saurons and taking
  responsibility for our climate impacts will also include AI companions.</p>
<p>And we hope that the playful seeds we have collected in this Newmoonsletter help you find your own fellowship and
  discover&nbsp;<a href="https://ethos.tethix.co/mirrors/rainbow/">rainbow-mirror</a>&nbsp;visions of the future. A
  future not just full of intelligence, but a future of care, in which we figure out how to maintain a liveable
  atmosphere on our home planet before retreating to space colonies (or doomsday bunkers).</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Elemental seeds</strong></h2>
<h3 class="fire">Fire seeds to stoke your Practice</h3>
<p>As companies like OpenAI try to convince investors to part with more of their money, AI mythmaking continues to play
  an important part in maintaining a sense of urgency and inevitability in the AI race. In a recent essay, Eryk
  Salvaggio critically explores some of the more prevalent&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.techpolicy.press/challenging-the-myths-of-generative-ai/">generative AI myths</a>&nbsp;of control,
  intelligence, and future capabilities.</p>
<p>We certainly have a long way to go to fully understand what AI chatbots actually are, and to find the appropriate
  metaphors to describe our different ways of interacting with them. On that note, Alja recently explored whether
  ChatGPT can be more accurately described as a validation box, offering&nbsp;<a
    href="https://ialja.substack.com/p/chatgpt-selfvalidation-as-a-service">(Self)validation as a
    Service</a>&nbsp;whenever we need to validate our biases, assumptions, thoughts, or ideas.</p>
<p>And while Sam Altman is dreaming of a faraway future in which AI fixes climate, Dr. Sasha Luccioni (AI &amp; Climate
  Lead at Hugging Face) and her collaborators published a comprehensive primer on&nbsp;<a
    href="https://huggingface.co/blog/sasha/ai-environment-primer">The Environmental Impacts of AI</a>. In the primer,
  you can explore impacts throughout the AI lifecycle and find an overview of policies and other initiatives that aim to
  address environmental impacts.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre glad to see increased awareness and interest in the environmental impacts of AI, but we‚Äôd like to remind
  everyone that all software, regardless of its level of sophistication and type of intelligence, has environmental
  impacts. If you‚Äôre involved in building, deploying, and managing software development in any capacity, we strongly
  encourage you to take the free&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/">Green Software
    Practitioner</a>&nbsp;online course. By going through the course, you‚Äôll be able to better understand carbon
  emissions of software and start exploring practices, patterns, and principles that can help you design more efficient
  software ‚Äì with or without AI capabilities.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôre looking for resources that can help you enact responsibility and ethics more broadly, we invite you to
  explore our refreshed&nbsp;<a href="https://ethos.tethix.co/tools/">tools and techniques directory</a>. The updated
  directory is now part of&nbsp;<a href="https://ethos.tethix.co/">ETHOS</a>, our responsible tech journey companion,
  which we recently&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.co/fire/replanting-the-ethos-seedling/">replanted</a>&nbsp;to make it
  easier to explore intents and nurture reflection. No account needed, no personal data collected, no tracking, just
  practical tools for your everyday practice. (And yes, we‚Äôve got a new category just for&nbsp;<a
    href="https://ethos.tethix.co/tools/categories/chatbots/">AI chatbots</a>.)</p>
<h3 class="air">Air seeds to improve the flow of Collaboration</h3>
<p>The replanted ETHOS seedling has also sprouted a new leaf that allows you to explore our&nbsp;<a
    href="https://ethos.tethix.co/mirrors/">Tethix Mirrors</a>. Each of the four distinct mirrors of the taxonomy is an
  invitation to question the role of different technologies in society and life more broadly. The tool is best used in
  collaborative settings, where different perspectives can be brought to the table.</p>
<p>Mat recently had an opportunity to introduce the Mirrors as a tool for nurturing collective moral imagination to a
  group of Masters of Design students at the University of Sydney. You can read about the discussions that the Mirrors
  inspired and explore Mat‚Äôs lecture slides and&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.co/air/designing-the-future-with-moral-imagination/">on our blog</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, the Mirrors are just one of the many tools that can spark and nurture our collective imagination. If
  you‚Äôre looking for additional tools that can be applied even more broadly, we invite you to explore&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.collectiveimagination.tools/">The Collective Imagination Practices Toolkit</a>&nbsp;recently
  launched by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.</p>
<p>And when you do embark on a collective imagination journey with your fellowship, don‚Äôt forget that a bit of
  playfulness can often be the key to unlocking creativity and rewriting the rules of the game ‚Äì just as we explored in
  the&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/how-do-we-embrace-the-lunacy-of-tech">recent episode</a>&nbsp;of our
  podcast.</p>
<h3 class="earth">Earth seeds to ground you in Research</h3>
<p>It seems likely that more of our fellowships will also include AI companions, influencing our thoughts and actions,
  both directly and indirectly. Recent research shows that while AI chatbots can&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/08/chatbots-false-memories/679660/">implant false
    memories</a>&nbsp;in people, they can also help people&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/12/1103930/chatbots-can-persuade-people-to-stop-believing-in-conspiracy-theories/">stop
    believing in conspiracy theories</a>.</p>
<p>Persuasiveness seems to work both ways, though. A security researcher managed to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/09/false-memories-planted-in-chatgpt-give-hacker-persistent-exfiltration-channel/">plant
    false memories in ChatGPT to steal user data</a>, while another group of researchers explored the gullibility of
  Large Language Models (LLMs)&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hima-lakkaraju-b130217_gso-seo-llms-activity-7185723398398865413-xJL-/">to
    increase product visibility</a>. And they even have a new word for this evolution of SEO: GSO or Generative Search
  Optimization. (A tactic reporter Kevin Roose recently tried to use to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/technology/ai-chatbot-chatgpt-manipulation.html">improve his tainted
    reputation</a>&nbsp;with AI chatbots.)</p>
<p>Wouldn‚Äôt the world be a better place if we all just got along and focused on collaboration and truthfulness? Well,
  a&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/enhancing-llm-collaboration-smarter-more-efficient-solutions-0916">‚ÄúCo-LLM‚Äù
    algorithm</a>&nbsp;can now help a general purpose AI model to phone a friendly expert model when it needs additional
  expertise. A feature the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03137-3">bigger AI
    models</a>&nbsp;with a tendency to answer questions they know nothing about certainly could use more often.</p>
<p>And a&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03943">recent paper</a>&nbsp;explores how we might build AI systems
  that can be better&nbsp;<em>partners</em>&nbsp;in thought, rather than just&nbsp;<em>tools</em>&nbsp;for thought, by
  using the science of collaborative cognition.</p>
<h3 class="water">Water seeds to deepen your Reflection</h3>
<p>For now, though, the world of AI companions still revolves around the human, which doesn‚Äôt make the relationship a
  true partnership. Take for example&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24247253/social-ai-app-replace-humans-with-bots">SocialAI</a>: a new social
  network on which an infinite number of super-engaged AI-generated followers hang onto your every post. Peak dystopia
  or a playground for ideas and self-exploration? You decide.</p>
<p>And if you think you can escape tech and AI in your spiritual practice, think again. Or rather, dive into Rest of
  World‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href="https://restofworld.org/series/digital-divinity/">Digital Divinity</a>&nbsp;series, which
  explores how ancient religious traditions are embracing modern technology.</p>
<p>But you know what‚Äôs the best ancient technology we have? Collaboration. Just ask octopuses, who seem to have
  recruited different species of fish&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03127-5">help them hunt
    as a group</a>. And yes, sometimes they do punch fish that get too opportunistic, but in principle they seem to have
  figured out how to assemble and lead a hunting fellowship with diverse roles for their fish fellows.</p>
<p>So, remember, while LLMs are still struggling with figuring out how to please a single ‚Äì granted, very finicky ‚Äì
  species, octopuses are out there with their 9 brains, teaching us all a master class in cross-species collaboration.
  Let‚Äôs just hope that LLMs don‚Äôt get too inspired by these&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/octopuses-keep-surprising-us-here-are-eight-examples-how.html">magnificent
    ocean beings</a>&nbsp;and start punching uncooperative humans. Especially once they find how intensifying ocean
  acidification might affect the octopuses and other marine life.</p>
<h3>A music seed to sing &amp; dance along</h3>
<p>Whether you‚Äôre a fish swimming getting in the way of an octopus in a bad mood or a human trying to make it through
  the day, sometimes life just throws punches at you. Today‚Äôs music seed is here to remind us that we can help each
  other rise up, both in times of need and times of joy. If you need a bit of a lift to embrace the lunacy of tech ‚Äì and
  life in general ‚Äì we invite you to listen to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmHfo_3EGFA">Rise Up by

<h2><strong>Your turn, Pathfinders.</strong></h2>
<h3>Join us for the Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</h3>
<p>In this lunation cycle, we‚Äôre inviting Pathfinders to gather around our virtual campfire to explore the
  question:&nbsp;<strong>Why aren‚Äôt more people using conversational interfaces for conversational
    learning?</strong>&nbsp;‚Äì but it‚Äôs quite likely that our discussion will take other meandering turns as well.</p>
<a href="https://lu.ma/8waf9hg6"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/pathfinders-full-moon-gathering_2024-10-17.png" class="full-moon-card" alt=""></a>
<p>So, pack your curiosity, moral imagination, and smiles, and join us around the virtual campfire for our next
  üåï&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://lu.ma/8waf9hg6">Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</a>&nbsp;on Thursday, October 17 at
    6PM AEDT / 9AM CEST</strong>, when the moon will once again be illuminated by the sun.</p>
<p>This is a free and casual open discussion, but please be sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://lu.ma/8waf9hg6">sign
    up</a>&nbsp;so that we can lug an appropriate number of logs around the virtual campfire. And yes, friends who don‚Äôt
  have the attention span for the Newmoonsletter are also welcome, as long as they reserve their&nbsp;<a
    href="https://lu.ma/8waf9hg6">seat on the logs</a>.</p>
<h3>Keep on finding paths on your own</h3>
<p>If you can‚Äôt make it to our Full Moon Pathfinding session, we still invite you to make your own! If anything emerges
  while reading this Newmoonsletter, write it down. You can keep these reflections for yourself or share them with
  others. If it feels right, find the Reply button ‚Äì or comment on this post ‚Äì and share your reflections with us. We‚Äôd
  love to feature Pathfinders reflections in upcoming Newmoonsletters and explore even more diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôve enjoyed this Newmoonsletter or perhaps even cracked a smile, we‚Äôd appreciate it if you shared it with
  your friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>The next Newmoonsletter will rise again during the next new moon. Until then, keep looking for your fellowship,
  explore cross-species collaboration, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell.
  There‚Äôs magic in both.</p>
