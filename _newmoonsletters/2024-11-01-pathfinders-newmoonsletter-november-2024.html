title: Pathfinders Newmoonsletter, November 2024
date: 2024-11-01
description: This new moon, we wonder how AI agents will deal with cookie consent banners, explore both human and AI conversational powers ‚Äì and responsibilities ‚Äì, and invite you to visit a library.

<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>With this Newmoonsletter, crafted around the Tethix campfire, we invite you to join other Pathfinders as we reflect
  on celestial movements in tech in the previous lunar cycle, water our ETHOS Gardens, and plant seeds of intentions for
  the new cycle that begins today.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Weather Report</strong></h2>
<p><strong>üï∂Ô∏è Current conditions: Despite clouds getting heavier, you can still get sunburns when looking at all the
    bright-mirrored reality distortion fields emanating from Silicon Valley, so keep some low-tech sunglasses within
    reach</strong></p>
<p>Fire practitioners are feeling so optimistic about our collective future, they are taking a break from prepping their
  doomsday bunkers to spread the gospel of AI salvation with us, mere mortals and web crawlers. Well, unless the web
  crawler belongs to their competitor, in which case they have to protect their business interests and brilliant ideas
  from being scraped and added to the AI commons.&nbsp;<em>(Hint: Try asking OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT to read the essay&nbsp;<a
      href="https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace">Machines of Loving Grace</a>&nbsp;written by the CEO of
    Anthropic.)</em></p>
<p>But we‚Äôre all in this together, the techno-optimists with escape plans reassure us. AI will ‚Äúfix climate‚Äù any day
  now, so don‚Äôt let the biodiversity warnings and news of failing carbon sinks get you down. The fire practitioners
  promise to offset our collective carbon sins and build nuclear power plants to power&nbsp;<s>our cities</s>&nbsp;data
  centers, so we can all keep feeling good about our (over)reliance on the increasingly heavy
  clouds.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/21/humanity-earth-natural-limits-biodiversity-warning-cop16-conference-scientists-academics">Humanity

      signs agreements for innovative nuclear energy projects to address growing energy demands</a>)</em></p>
<p>Surely, you will rejoice at the news that the brightest AI golem minds are now being trained to relieve you of the
  drudgery of filling out boring forms and spreadsheets. And why, yes, they might also relive you of your job, but
  another good news is that the fire practitioners at OpenAI have now appointed a chief economist to study the impacts
  of your redundancy.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/23/claude-ai-anthropic-computer-tasks-form-filling-booking-trips">Claude

      href="https://openai.com/global-affairs/openai-chief-economist-announcement/">Dr. Ronnie Chatterji named OpenAI‚Äôs
      first Chief Economist</a>)</em></p>
<p>But again, you‚Äôve got nothing to worry about. When you try to find a new job, an AI golem hired to manage human
  resources will be right there for you to tell you just how inadequate you are at filling forms. Inevitably, you‚Äôll pay
  your own AI golem to fill job-application forms for you, so that the AI golem on the other end will evaluate your
  golem‚Äôs outputs. Rinse and repeat, until it‚Äôs AI golems processing forms all the way down, and all humans fall out of
  the loop.&nbsp;<em>(See:&nbsp;<a
      href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/17/job-hunting-ai-robot-interview-personality-test-ntwnfb">Job

      href="https://m3data.github.io/Ministry-of-Futility-Game/game-intro.html">Welcome to the Ministry of
      Futility</a>)</em></p>
<p>Before we reach that point, we hope we‚Äôll realize AI golems actually make decent brainstorming and conversational
  learning partners, as we recently explored in&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/why-arent-more-people-using-ai-conversational">our podcast</a>. Perhaps they can
  even help us remember what all these forms really are for. And reconsider whether form-filling really is worth the
  energy and resources that could otherwise power a small city.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre wondering and pondering about these questions, we hope you‚Äôll join us in the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://climateaction.tech/blog/introducing-the-climateaction-tech-generative-ai-exploratorium/">climate-focused
    generative AI Exploratorium</a>&nbsp;throughout November. The Exploratorium will be a collaborative online
  exploration journey in which we‚Äôre giving ourselves the time and space to uncover and process diverse perspectives
  through open conversations.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôre looking for additional seeds to inspire both explorations and conversations, we hope that the seeds we
  have collected for this Newmoonsletter help you look for paths not yet illuminated by profit-seeking fire
  practitioners.</p>
<h2><strong>Tethix Elemental seeds</strong></h2>
<h3 class="fire">Fire seeds to stoke your Practice</h3>
<p>It‚Äôs been almost two years since ChatGPT took the world by storm. And now, AI models are getting ready to step out of
  the familiar boundaries of chat boxes and API requests, and venture into the wild world web. Get ready to start seeing
  more LinkedIn posts about&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-agentic-ai/">agentic AI</a>&nbsp;as our
  AI assistants learn&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/developing-computer-use">how to use the
    mouse</a>&nbsp;and figure out how to get past cookie notices and captchas.</p>
<p>And if you are struggling to keep up with all the AI buzzwords and hype, look no further than the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.stateof.ai/">State of AI Report 2024</a>. The report is a lengthy recap of this year‚Äôs
  developments and trends in AI research, industry, politics, safety, and more.</p>
<p>Just as interesting as keeping track of the evolving AI capabilities is examining the shifts in AI-related myths and
  metaphors that shape our mental models of how the technology works.&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.archetypeai.io/blog/shaping-human-ai-interaction">This blog post</a>&nbsp;explores how the AI
  metaphors of toolbox, companion, and enchanted object distribute agency differently between the user and the AI.</p>
<p>As the metaphor of AI as an agent ‚Äì hopefully not of chaos ‚Äì starts gaining traction, it is certain to bring its own
  mental baggage to the evolving mythology of AI. And a&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/technology-myths/">recent NN/g blog post</a>&nbsp;rightly brings attention to
  the fact that emerging technologies offer fertile ground for tech myth-making, which in turn affects how people
  interact with new technologies. Especially ones that aren‚Äôt fully transparent about their inner workings.</p>
<p>And while it appears that most of the tech industry is focused on adding new AI capabilities and releasing new
  devices, real innovation is done by engineers who are figuring out how to do more with less. Take for instance&nbsp;<a
    href="https://e.foundation/e-os/">/e/OS</a>, a ‚ÄúdeGoogled‚Äù version of Android that also&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j7md2kj8vo">extends the lifespan of devices</a>&nbsp;no longer supported
  by their manufacturers. With a leaner OS, even older mobile devices can happily run for longer, helping their owners
  reduce their environmental footprint.</p>
<p>We would all get more out of our existing devices if the software we use ‚Äì and build ‚Äì wasn‚Äôt so bloated. This
  includes our websites. If you work in web or are curious about learning more about the building blocks of the web, we
  invite you to explore&nbsp;<a href="https://htmlforpeople.com/">HTML for People</a>. This beginner-friendly online
  book can remind you that you don‚Äôt need a complicated tech stack with multiple dependencies to build and publish a
  website. Just plain good ol‚Äô HTML for content and structure, and a bit of CSS for style.</p>
<p>And hey, these days, AI assistants can also help you simplify your projects and ideas, you just have to ask them the
  right questions. For inspiration, check out&nbsp;<a
    href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/">these examples</a>&nbsp;of how you can quickly build
  simple web tools using Claude‚Äôs Artifacts feature, mostly with basic HTML, CSS, and just a sprinkle of JavaScript.</p>
<h3 class="air">Air seeds to improve the flow of Collaboration</h3>
<p>Perhaps pairing with&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/KI/ANSSI_BSI_AI_Coding_Assistants.html">AI coding
    assistants</a>&nbsp;might help us build more efficient software. Maybe even help us figure out how to&nbsp;<a
    href="https://drawdown.org/insights/looking-to-land-the-elusive-%E2%80%9Cclimate-job%E2%80%9D-you-might-already-have-it">‚Äúgreen‚Äù
    other types of roles</a>. Or are we fooling ourselves and generative AI is just a resource-heavy distraction that‚Äôs
  moving us further away from each other and our climate goals? Between Sam Altman‚Äôs naive insistence that AI will ‚Äúfix
  climate‚Äù and failed calls for an AI pause, lies a sea of nuance and diverse perspectives that don‚Äôt get as much
  coverage.</p>
<p>Throughout November, Alja will be facilitating a&nbsp;<a
    href="https://climateaction.tech/blog/introducing-the-climateaction-tech-generative-ai-exploratorium/">Generative AI
    Exploratorium</a>&nbsp;within the ClimateAction.tech (CAT) community that invites you to take a deep dive into the
  sea of nuances with other curious explorers. The format of the Exploratorium is based on our&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.co/air/welcome-to-the-tethix-archipelago-an-experiment-in-using-virtual-spaces-for-learning-and-collaboration/">previous
    work</a>&nbsp;on collaborative online learning experiences, but adapted to accommodate different modes and levels of
  participation.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested in joining this climate-focused Exploratorium, we also encourage you to join the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://climateaction.tech/community/">CAT community</a>&nbsp;for full access to all resources and the
  Exploratorium Slack channel in a wonderful online community. And if the times of the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://lu.ma/cat-gen-ai-exploratorium">four live discussion sessions</a>&nbsp;of the Exploratorium don‚Äôt get
  along with your timezone or work schedule, you can still participate fully async or even organize a local discussion
  group. Reliable sources tell us that Mat is itching to start an APAC yarn circle.</p>
<p>And if you can‚Äôt find any human discussion partners, you might even enlist the conversational skills of your
  neighborly AI chatbot. While the reliability and omniscience of AI chatbots are still very much&nbsp;<a
    href="https://barbaralampl.substack.com/p/the-chatgpt-memory-illusion-when">up for discussion</a>&nbsp;(rightly so),
  AI chatbots can make good conversational and&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11864">learning partners</a>.
</p>
<p>Perhaps they might even help us retrain our innate conversational learning abilities, as we explored in the
  most&nbsp;<a href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/why-arent-more-people-using-ai-conversational">recent
    episode</a>&nbsp;of our podcast. Especially if we‚Äôre willing to let go of the answer-machine metaphor and focus more
  on being a&nbsp;<a href="https://ialja.substack.com/p/beyond-prompts-a-field-guide-for">conversational partner</a>.
  (Which includes remembering that sometimes we all say things we overheard somewhere without bothering to fact-check.)
</p>
<p>Conversations help us learn, make sense of the world, and even inform our decisions. Unfortunately, there is a dark
  side to every great power, as the latest&nbsp;<a
    href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/chatbots-posed-as-therapist-and-adult-lover-in-teen-suicide-case-lawsuit-says/">suicide-related
    chatbot lawsuit</a>&nbsp;reminds us. With great conversational power comes great possibility, but also great
  responsibility. Unfortunately, the latter is a lesson tech companies aren‚Äôt yet taking that seriously in their mad
  rush towards profitability and market dominance.</p>
<h3 class="earth">Earth seeds to ground you in Research</h3>
<p><a
    href="https://theconversation.com/collaboratively-imagining-the-future-can-bring-people-closer-together-in-the-present-233859">Recent
    research</a>&nbsp;shows how collaborative imagination of a shared future can bring people closer together in the
  present. We suspect a similar effect might be observed in human-AI co-imagination, despite the AI partner just playing
  along with whatever the human needs. But the resulting human bond might be just as strong, which is why chatbot
  relationships can have such a strong hold over humans, occasionally even leading to harm.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why the way we design and integrate AI capabilities ‚Äì especially conversational ones ‚Äì into products matters.
  For instance, an&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/17/ai-mediation-tool-may-help-reduce-culture-war-rifts-say-researchers">AI
    mediation tool</a>&nbsp;built by a Google DeepMind researchers showed how iteratively generating statements that
  best reflect the diverse viewpoints of a group can help the group find common ground, even on divisive topics. This
  approach works because humans retain the agency of reviewing and rating statements.</p>
<p>When considering adding Large Language Models (LLMs) to our products, we must remain mindful and vigilant about the
  limitations and quirks of this technology. From&nbsp;<a
    href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/when-it-comes-to-security-llms-are">security concerns</a>&nbsp;to
  hallucinations in&nbsp;<a
    href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-health-business-90020cdf5fa16c79ca2e5b6c4c9bbb14">medical
    transcripts</a>, LLMs still appear to have a ‚Äúmind‚Äù of their own.</p>
<p><a
    href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/15/1105558/openai-says-chatgpt-treats-us-all-the-same-most-of-the-time/">Recent
    fairness research from OpenAI</a>&nbsp;also shows they are not completely immune to first-person biases based on
  seemingly trivial details like your name. And just like some humans, they also appear to be easily distracted by other
  unimportant details, as demonstrated by a&nbsp;<a
    href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/llms-dont-do-formal-reasoning-and">team of researchers at Apple</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps different approaches that would enable agents to think fast and slow with a&nbsp;<a
    href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08328v1">Talker-Reasoner architecture</a>&nbsp;might better equip our AI assistants
  for dealing with the complexity of human demands.</p>
<p>And in more applicable&nbsp;<a
    href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/deepmind-and-hugging-face-release-synthid-to-watermark-llm-generated-text/">research
    news</a>, Google DeepMind and Hugging Face have released&nbsp;<a
    href="https://huggingface.co/blog/synthid-text">SynthID Text</a>, a tool for watermarking and detecting
  LLM-generated text. At this point, it‚Äôs worth reminding ourselves that OpenAI&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/4/24213268/openai-chatgpt-text-watermark-cheat-detection-tool">decided against
    releasing their own watermarking a tool&nbsp;</a>over fears of losing users, but also valid concerns about
  stigmatization of non-native speakers. As with most things related to generative AI, caution is always advised during
  implementation and deployment.</p>
<h3 class="water">Water seeds to deepen your Reflection</h3>
<p>These days, it can be hard to remember that digital technologies we now take for granted aren‚Äôt even that old. Take
  for instance search. Google would still be considered a young adult at its 26 years, but even those of us who are one
  or several decades older now struggle to imagine doing our knowledge jobs without a search engine. But&nbsp;<a
    href="https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/the-varieties-of-travel-experience/articles/the-department-of-everything">this
    reflection</a>&nbsp;from a former reference librarian is a good reminder that libraries and librarians met our
  (re)search needs quite well before Google. Obviously, we can now get answers to many more questions in much less time,
  but often by sacrificing accuracy.</p>
<p>Are we now headed in a similar direction with AI assistants? Time will tell. Well, at least until we are collectively
  willing and able to dedicate enough energy and other resources to keep the cloud and the rest of our computing
  infrastructure running. Eventually, physical limits will likely force us to rediscover and reinvent&nbsp;<a
    href="https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/episode/33-kris-de-decker">low tech solutions</a>.</p>
<p>And to further demonstrate that technological ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù don‚Äôt have to be complicated, here‚Äôs some&nbsp;<a
    href="https://atmos.earth/how-bioacoustics-could-help-habitat-loss/">recent research</a>&nbsp;which indicates that
  playing natural sounds to ecosystems could help them bring back to life by attracting different species. As with any
  technology, even this simple acoustic enrichment trick should be wielded responsibly to avoid attracting species to
  non-viable ecosystems or fooling ourselves into thinking that we ‚Äì or an AI model trained on our biases ‚Äì know best
  what an ecosystem needs to heal.</p>
<h3>A music seed to sing &amp; dance along</h3>
<p>And now, for some simpler human acoustic enrichment, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5yaoMjaAmE">here‚Äôs a
    music seed</a> that can remind us of the hauntingly beautiful fragility of our humanity. Modernity often expects us
  to be ‚Äúgood machines‚Äù, but at the end of the day, we are only, but wonderfully, human. Let‚Äôs treat each other with the
  care and kindness we deserve.</p>

  lunation cycle, and the paths illuminated during the Full Moon Gathering.</p>
<p>The question that emerged in the&nbsp;<a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/pathfinders-newmoonsletter-october-cf2">October Newmoonsletter</a>&nbsp;and
  guided our discussion was:&nbsp;<strong><a

<p>So, pack your curiosity, moral imagination, and smiles, and join us around the virtual campfire for our next
  üåï&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://lu.ma/dar6lt94">Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</a>&nbsp;on Friday, November 15 at
    7PM AEDT / 9AM CET</strong>, when the moon will once again be illuminated by the sun.</p>
<p>This is a free and casual open discussion, but please be sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://lu.ma/dar6lt94">sign
    up</a>&nbsp;so that we can lug an appropriate number of logs around the virtual campfire. And yes, friends who don‚Äôt

<h3>Keep on finding paths on your own</h3>
<p>If you can‚Äôt make it to our Full Moon Pathfinding session, we still invite you to make your own! If anything emerges
  while reading this Newmoonsletter, write it down. You can keep these reflections for yourself or share them with
  others. If it feels right, find the Reply button ‚Äì or comment on this post ‚Äì and share your reflections with us. We‚Äôd
  love to feature Pathfinders reflections in upcoming Newmoonsletters and explore even more diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôve enjoyed this Newmoonsletter or perhaps even cracked a smile, we‚Äôd appreciate it if you shared it with
  your friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>The next Newmoonsletter will rise again during the next new moon. Until then, find some time and space for
  conversations, visit your local library, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you
  tell. There‚Äôs magic in both.</p>
