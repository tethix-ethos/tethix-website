  Under the Black Moon we wonder: what now? Can we stop pretending everything is fine? Is it time to root and ground in place? What feels worth nurturing in 2025?

<h2>This is not your usual Newmoonsletter.</h2>
<p>Welcome to December, the month of yearly recaps, reflections, and goal setting. It appears we are not immune to this
  collective impulse to reflect as we reach the final page of the Gregorian calendar (even though we believe we should
  be celebrating the new year during the spring equinox).</p>
<p>If we had to sum up 2024 in one image, the evergreen <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine">“This is
    fine.”</a> meme feels like a perfect fit yet again.</p>

<div class="image-caption"><em>Human-generated image by <a href="https://gunshowcomic.com/648">KC Green</a></div>

<p>So we wanted to take a moment to check in with you.</p>
<p><strong>Are you tired of pretending everything is fine?</strong></p>
<p>We certainly are. Because everything is most definitely not fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.planetaryhealthcheck.org/">Our house is on fire</a>.</p>
<p>The fire practitioners of Silicon Valley are gaining increasing political power, now using internet memes to name
  government departments. Their AI golems are being deployed to squeeze the last drops of productivity and human decency
  in a broken system. For every insightful article on the environmental impacts and questionable ethics of the gen AI
  wildfire, there’s at least dozens more blinding us with promises of productivity gains and godlike superpowers.</p>
<p>We’re being asked to speak about responsible AI on panels, while knowing damn well it’s mostly just performative talk
  that will not pay our bills. We’re supposed to feed social media algorithms with our outrage, hot-takes, hustling and
  bustling to justify our value and afford an existence constantly on the verge of a burnout. Too busy for family, too
  busy for friends, too busy to get to know our neighbors, too busy to grow our food, too busy to live.</p>
<p>We're all hurting in different ways. Even if we don't agree on what is hurting us most.</p>
<p>The absurdity of business as usual is becoming so clear it's probably visible from space at this point. (At least
  until the space junk problem, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drspacejunk.bsky.social/post/3lbpzscppws2j">amplified
    by Starlink</a>, doesn't get out of control.)</p>
<p>We can’t keep designing and developing websites, and building digital products like everything is fine.</p>
<p>So what now?</p>

<p>Do we start smashing the data centers? Perhaps.</p>
<p>Whatever you decide to do, this is the time to start bending and breaking the rules. Rewriting the rules of the game.
  Facing our shadows. Reconnecting with our bodies, the bodies around us, and the bodies of the lands in which we live.
  And listening to what all these bodies are <em>dying</em> to say – often, quite literally.</p>
<p>Now is the time for letting the tears flow, screaming into the void, dancing like nobody’s watching, singing at the
  top of your lungs with your coven, … Whatever you need to do to feel like a human with agency and a body again.</p>
<p>On this Black Moon<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1"
    href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>, we’re allowing ourselves to break the rules of the Newmoonsletter. Allowing
  ourselves to get real, <em>raw</em>, and personal with you. A small act of rebellion, perhaps. Perhaps something to
  inspire the next generation of large language models that will try to figure out what the hell humans want by
  ingesting this text.</p>
<p>Hopefully, something that inspires you, human, to share how you truly feel with others, and to reflect on what
  <em>your</em> project 2025 should be. Because we suspect you, as a Pathfinder, aren’t buying the bullshit dystopian
  visions the tech billionaires are trying to sell us while building their cozy doomsday bunkers either.</p>

<h2>A time for rooting and grounding.</h2>
<p>Recently, a quote from the Atmos essay <a href="https://atmos.earth/overview-election-tree-of-life/">Tree of Life</a>
  has resonated strongly with both of us:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>The etymology of the word “radical” comes from “radix” meaning “root.” As Angela Davis once said, “radical
      simply means grasping things at the root.” For me, at this moment, that means regrounding ourselves in our
      purpose. Rather than turning on each other, let’s refocus on what needs to be done. Just as Yyggdrasil’s roots
      reach into the nether realms, we can draw strength from and allow ourselves to be radicalized by the pain we feel
      now, and let it motivate us to act.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Newmoonsletter, we’ve been gathering seeds of inspiration for the past 14 moons. Now we wonder, have any of
  these seeds germinated? Have they had enough oxygen in the air, have they been able to reach moist, fertile soil in
  which a radicle can emerge from the seed?</p>
<p>As the world is getting weirder, it’s time to root and ground. We cannot connect to the ecologies around us and
  re-attune to the relationality of life if we’re un-rooted, un-grounded, or up-rooted. It’s time to root and ground in
  place, find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters_(agriculture)">companions</a> that can support
  us, to be able to withstand the strong winds and other forces that are constantly trying to uproot us.</p>
<p>So, instead of speaking to your intellect, we wanted to speak to your heart-mind, to your gut, to your soul, whatever
  you prefer to call it. If generative AI has taught us anything with its ability to convincingly mimic human thought
  through language, it is to appreciate what is still uniquely human: our bodies.</p>
<p>The fire practitioners of Silicon Valley might consider our bodies a bug in the system, a flaw to eliminate. We’re
  inviting you to reconnect with your body and the bodies around you, and be curious about everything our bodies can do
  that defies logic and cannot (yet) be imitated by software running on silicon.</p>
<p>And to pay attention to what is happening to all our bodies as we spend an increasing amount of time in companionship
  with silicon bodies. And how different our bodies – both human and more than human – feel when they connect with each
  other through direct touch.</p>

<div class="image-caption"><strong>A meeting of bodies at different stages of life:</strong> A majestic Moreton Bay fig spreads its roots wide and deep in the Newton Cemetery &amp; Arboretum on Gadigal Country, Newtown, Sydney. As Mat’s son plays beneath its sheltering canopy, we are reminded that even the grandest of beings begin as small, vulnerable whispers of life.</div>

<h2>Reflecting on what <em>feels</em> worth nurturing.</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing: we do not know yet what the Newmoonsletter will look like in 2025. What we do know is that
  collecting seeds isn’t enough anymore, we need to nurture conditions for seed germination, for rooting, and grounding
  with our bodies.</p>
<p>Sure, we could do the obvious thing and keep pointing out the absurdity and lunacy of tech. But, at this point, the
  satire writes itself, as it gets increasingly harder to distinguish actual news from <a
    href="https://theonion.com/">The Onion</a>.</p>
<p>And we could keep weaving the intellectual threads between the articles we read, making ourselves – and you – feel
  awfully clever and informed, but do any of us truly need more content to consume? Isn’t your mind already
  oversaturated by breaking news, hot-takes, research, and essays that intellectualize the existential dread we
  <em>feel</em>?</p>
<p>So instead, allow us to share some things we recently <em>felt in our bodies</em> as worth nurturing.</p>
<p>In the past lunation, Alja ran a <a href="https://climateaction.tech/blog/tag/gen-ai-exploratorium/">Generative AI
    Exploratorium</a> with the ClimateAction.tech community. And while the Exploratorium offered participants plenty of
  resources to support the exploration, the real magic unfolded during the open discussions. When <em>people</em> were
  given the time and space to share stories, experiences, and process their conflicting emotions together.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mat has been working on Collective Futurecrafting pilots in his local community in Sydney. Inspired by
  local activists, elders, and healers, he is envisioning circles of people coming together to feel, to dream, to heal,
  and explore pathways and take action to address both local and systemic challenges. He’s starting small, by
  interfacing with the Parents &amp; Citizens groups embedded in schools.</p>
<p>We’ve also been getting reports of how students’ moral imagination has been tickled by the <a
    href="https://tethix.co/air/designing-the-future-with-moral-imagination/">Rainbow Mirrors lecture</a> Mat held at
  the University of Sydney two moons ago. And there’s been many insightful private messages about his <a
    href="https://m3data.github.io/Ministry-of-Futility-Game/game-intro.html">Ministry of Futility</a> game. (We do hope
  that more people will feel comfortable sharing these thoughts in public.)</p>
<p>And we made Gemma – Mat’s wife, no relation to Google’s AI models – laugh with the <a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/s/pathfinders-podcast">Pathfinders Podcast</a> by exploring how we relate to
  technology through the lens of popular culture references. Gemma has been invaluable in ensuring we have the time and
  space to yarn together at lengths. And the gift of the laughter is the least we can give back to everyone who has been
  supporting our crazy visions in these past three years of our shared adventure.</p>
<p>Besides, laughter should never be underestimated. Whether we’re laughing at the absurdity of the tech world or our
  own ridiculousness, laughing reconnects us to something deeper—a spark of joy that ripples outward, softening the
  edges of the weight we carry. It’s a rhythm that feels timeless, a small but profound rebellion against the tide of
  despair.</p>
<p>Perhaps laughter is one of humanity’s most powerful tools – unassuming, yet profoundly necessary – as we face what
  lies ahead. It reminds us that even in shadow, light can be found.</p>
<p>In these increasingly dark times, our Eastern European ancestry – a surprising connection we share, despite living in
  different hemispheres – stirs up, bringing a bottle of home-brewed <em><a
      href="https://www.theworldwasherefirst.com/drink-rakija-like-local/">rakija</a></em> to the table and inviting us
  to embrace dark humor as we dance <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolo_(dance)">kolo</a></em> with our
  shadows.</p>
<p>On some days, <em>“Still alive,”</em> is a perfectly reasonable answer to <em>“How are you?”</em>, as Alja keeps
  reminding Mat. And then we yarn, we make each other laugh as we reflect on the lunacy of tech and all other business
  as usual. In between, Mat’s kids or Alja’s cats wave at the camera across over 16 thousand kilometers that separate
  us. And we feel more human, more grounded. Even though our seasons never match.</p>
<p>Being human, actually human, is messy, weird, awkward, devastating, often loud. <em>“Never apologize for your kids
    being comfortable enough to express their emotions,”</em> Alja keeps telling Mat after they’ve burst into his office
  to share some experience. The kids are our canaries in the coal mine. The coal mines we’re taking too close to shut
  down because of our addition to extraction and growth.</p>
<p>But being human is also heart-warming, joyful, funny, and magical, as laughing, dancing, a deep conversation, or
  feeling part of a community remind us. So it is these little moments – of connection, of codesinging, playing,
  imagining, sharing stories of grief and ecoanxiety, yarning around real and virtual campfires – that we will continue
  nurturing going forward.</p>
<p>The stretch of our human bodies, a silly dance, a shared laugh, a warm smile, a cup of tea together. These simple
  acts are but a quiet and powerful rebellion against the numbing tide of our current paradigm.</p>
<p>It is this world that we rebel against – a world that cultivates apathy and demands disconnection from our shared
  humanity and more than human life. Instead, we choose to be <em>radicle</em>.</p>
<p>Will you join us?</p>
<h2>Your invitation to engage in meandering conversations</h2>
<p>In the latest episode of <a href="https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast">Pathfinders Podcast</a>, we started
  unpacking the shadows of (artificial) intelligence by exploring its history, pop culture references, and different
  contexts. We danced with the question: <strong><a
      href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/how-intelligent-do-ai-companions">How intelligent do AI companions actually
      need to be?</a></strong></p>
<p>You can watch the full episode on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQmj0jNAg6Y">YouTube</a>, or listen to it
  on <a href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/how-intelligent-do-ai-companions">Substack</a> or in your favorite podcast

<p>During the first Full Moon of 2025, we invite you – yes, you! – to join us around the virtual campfire for our next
  🌕 <strong><a href="https://lu.ma/oa5qb5j7">Pathfinders Full Moon Gathering</a> on Monday, January 13, 2025, at 7PM
    AEDT / 9AM CET</strong>, when the moon will once again be illuminated by the sun to yarn about the question:
  <strong>How do our human bodies fit into an AI enabled future?</strong></p>

<p>So, pack your curiosity, moral imagination, and smiles, and <a href="https://lu.ma/oa5qb5j7">sign up on the event
    page</a> so that we can lug an appropriate number of logs around the virtual campfire.</p>
<h2>An invitation to engage your feelings</h2>
<h3>A poetic seed crafted by Mat</h3>
<img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/collective-futurecrafting.jpeg" alt="">
<blockquote>
  <pre class="text">My heart is bursting. Our world is hurting.
A want to heal, I want to feel.

The pain of my child grieving for a future lost.
His tears tell a tale.
A bird no longer singing.
A river no longer flowing.
A flower no longer growing.
A future he thought was glowing.
The earth cracks open, and the sky grows heavy with forgetting.

I reach beyond my grasp.
I feel alone.

The calling of my ancestors.
The song of those unborn.
To feel. To dream. To act.

To imagine.

The future cries before me, its voice raw with the echoes of what we’ve left undone.

A circle shines.

It calls to me, not in words,
but in the soft hum of belonging.
I step closer, and find others waiting.

Hands open.
Eyes wide.
Hearts carrying the same ache.
Awaiting a shared embrace.
The wind whispering the same rhythmic words:
Can we dream together again?
Dream again, together.

We sit.
We speak.
We listen.

Stories weave between us like threads of gold,
binding what is broken that needs repair,
composting what is dying that no longer serves.

A bird sings again, softly at first,
But with the promise of dawn.

A river flows, not as it once did,
But as it might yet become.

The circles grow, a living geometry of active hope.

Its rhythm hums in the street before me
a hum of the earth calling,
its light reflects in the sky,
its pulse beats within us.

We are not alone.
We are circles within circles.
Life within life.

The future no longer cries.
It whispers.
It dreams.
It waits for our hands and hearts to craft it.

And so, together, we begin</pre>

<h2>About the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter</h2>
<p>As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter rises in your inbox to inspire
  collective pathfinding towards better tech futures.</p>
<p>We sync our monthly reflections to the lunar cycle as a reminder of our place in the Universe and a commonality we
  share across timezones and places we inhabit. New moon nights are dark and hence the perfect time to gaze into the
  stars and set new intentions.</p>
<p>If you’ve enjoyed this Newmoonsletter or perhaps even cracked a smile, we’d appreciate it if you shared it with your
  friends and colleagues, and leaving an offering to the algorithmic gods by engaging with it online.</p>
<p>The next Newmoonsletter will rise again during the first new moon in 2025. Until then, find some rules to bend and
  break, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell. There’s magic in both.</p>
<p>With 🙂 from the Tethix campfire,<br>Alja and Mat</p>
