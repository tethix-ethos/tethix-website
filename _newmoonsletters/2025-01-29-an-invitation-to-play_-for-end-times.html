description: In this Newmoonsletter, we reflect on our journey so far, and explore how play might be what we need to match the absurdity of current end times.

<h2>The problem with tech ethics</h2>
<p>About three years ago, we ‚Äì Alja and Mat, that is ‚Äì founded <a href="https://tethix.co/">Tethix</a> to make tech
  ethics more accessible and fun. Despite the 16 thousand kilometres or so that separate us, we found each other in
  cyberspace and realized we share a vision for crafting <strong>tools and narratives that close the ethical intent to
    action gap in product development</strong>.</p>
<p>But with the tech industry doubling down on breaking more things with unreliable AI implementations and increasing
  environmental footprints, we‚Äôre not sure tech companies actually care about closing the gap unless it‚Äôs legally
  mandated. It‚Äôs not that product development is done by bad people who don‚Äôt care. The people usually care, deeply.</p>
<p>But within the rules of the <a
    href="https://theconversation.com/monopoly-was-designed-100-years-ago-to-teach-the-dangers-of-capitalism-112198">game
    of Monopoly</a> we‚Äôre all being forced to play, good people don‚Äôt have the freedom and budgets to put their money
  where their heart is. And so the best they can typically do is to buy products and consulting that lead to
  checkbox-ticking compliance rather than meaningful systemic change. And there‚Äôs certainly a place for compliance and
  regulation, but that‚Äôs not what we created Tethix for ‚Äì and our bank accounts reflect that reality.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs clear that <strong>deeper systemic change is needed to put us in right relation with our technology</strong>.
  <em>‚ÄúAligning AI with human values‚Äù</em> might be the latest buzzword, but it does nothing to challenge the conditions
  that incentivize exploitative business models and practices.</p>
<h2>Our attempt at embracing the lunacy of tech</h2>
<p>Which is why we‚Äôve been gradually expanding the focus of our work together beyond just product development.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve had fun poking at the lunacy of tech through the <a href="https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#new-moon">Pathfinders
    Newmoonsletter</a>. We wanted to inspire collective pathfinding towards better tech futures by collecting and
  sharing <strong>seeds of inspiration from tech practitioners and researchers</strong>, and other inspiring humans.</p>
<p>But then tech billionaires started naming government departments after internet memes, <a
    href="https://www.404media.co/github-is-showing-the-trump-administration-scrubbing-government-web-pages-in-real-time/">scrubbing</a>
  diversity and inclusion off websites, and calling for more ‚Äúaggressive masculine energy‚Äù in tech ‚Äì among so, so many
  other things. And we realized that the needle on the absurdity meter we have been using to guide our musings has
  broken off due to unprecedented levels of absurdity.</p>
<p>Left without a working meter, we have to accept that we have to go beyond embracing the lunacy of tech. We
  <em>feel</em> it‚Äôs time to match that energy somehow.</p>
<p>We did briefly consider smashing data centers ‚Äì for legal purposes, purely hypothetically! ‚Äì but quickly realized
  that wouldn‚Äôt solve our problems. Besides, we kinda need them to maintain the fire at our virtual campfire while our
  physical bodies remain continents apart.</p>
<p>So what else can we do?</p>
<p>We started exploring this question in the <a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/pathfinders-newmoonsletter-black">Black Moon edition of our Newmoonsletter</a>.
  And our instincts pointed us towards our bodies, both human and more than human. And <strong>getting real, raw, and
    personal.</strong></p>
<h2>Finding acceptance in absurdity</h2>
<p>After some additional playful bodystorming around our virtual campfire, a light appeared at the end of the tunnel. A
  spark. A title:</p>
<div class="text-center fs-3">
  <p><strong>Playbook for End Times: <br>How to Embrace the Collapse of Civilization with Love and Smiles</strong></p>
</div>
<p>And it just felt right. Though countless conversations we‚Äôve been having, particularly in the last year, we feel the
  need to collectively process the anger, fear, anxiety that the current system is stoking. And what better way to do
  <em>all of that</em> than with a bit of playfulness. With love and smiles.</p>
<p>We see the <strong>Playbook for End Times</strong> as something worth downloading on your device. Something to read
  around the campfire in the evening on days when you get enough sunshine to charge your device. Something that will
  bring a smile to your face when you face the darkest shadows of our civilization, when Google and ChatGPT are no
  longer available to answer all your questions. Something to help you reconnect with your body, the bodies around you,
  and the body of the land in which you find yourself in during the end times.</p>
<p>Now, we are hoping we can get our sh*t together before it comes to this dystopian scenario in which we actually lose
  data centers and internet connectivity. But let‚Äôs face it, things are not looking good at the moment. Accepting how
  broken the current system is does not mean giving up. We see it as an invitation to <em>dance</em> with the absurdity,
  face the shadows, and <a href="https://collectivefuturecrafting.net/">collectively craft</a> a better future on the
  ashes of systems that no longer serve us ‚Äì if they ever did.</p>
<p>Is the Playbook an actual book of play? Does it take on its early <a
    href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/playbook">meaning</a> of a <em>‚Äúbook containing material for amusement‚Äù</em>?
  Or the more modern meaning of a book of strategies in a game? Time will tell. For now, it‚Äôs a title and an invitation.
</p>
<p>And it goes beyond what the pages of a book can even capture. It‚Äôs a broader invitation to <strong>Play_ for End
    Times, together</strong>.</p>
<h2>What does it mean to Play_ for End Times?</h2>
<p>It means‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¶ creating <strong>Play_lists</strong> that help you cope with end times, whether it‚Äôs music that lights a spark
      in your heart or puts a smile on your face.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¶ <strong>Play_finding</strong> paths to better futures in small, interconnected circles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¶ <strong>Play_crafting</strong> a better future in your neighbourhood and local community.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¶ <strong>Play_shifting</strong> by starving nazzissists of attention and directing our attention towards each
      other, towards community building.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¶ <strong>Play_ing</strong> with hostile algorithms to carve out spaces for learning and healing together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¶ <strong>Play_sharing</strong> the lessons from old stories or more recent histories and herstories to help each
      other remember and feel what has been forgotten.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¶ <strong>Play_learning</strong> by making science reports and forecasts easier to understand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¶ <strong>Play_making</strong> by bending and breaking the rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¶ <strong>Play_grounding</strong> by following your intuition, your gut.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It means facing the end times from a place of love. It means a different thing on different days. On some days, it
  means rest and taking a nap, ignoring all the news. On other days, it means taking over the streets and shouting at
  the top of our lungs. It means nurturing well-regulated nervous systems so we can support each other. It means
  dancing, it means loving, it means imagining and questioning. It means not obeying in advance. It means being the
  positive deviants the world needs.</p>
<p>It means <strong>filling in the blanks with your dreams and hopes, with your imagination</strong>.</p>
<h2>Why play when things are getting so serious?</h2>
<p>We‚Äôre playing for end times to let go of our baggage. Of the expectations of perfection. We‚Äôre playing to help us
  embrace the messy, the weird, the woo. We‚Äôre playing to imagine <a
    href="https://ethos.tethix.co/mirrors/rainbow/">rainbow mirrors</a> because we refuse to accept the dark, bright,
  and grey <a href="https://ethos.tethix.co/mirrors/">mirrors</a> as our only options.</p>
<p>As players, we have to train our imagination and find our fellowship to be able to face game bosses at increasing
  levels of difficulty. Through play, we get the chance to know ourselves and the role each of us can play in these end
  times. Are you a tank fighting on the front lines, a mage casting powerful spells from a safe distance, a stealth
  rogue working in the shadows, or a healer supporting the entire party?</p>
<p>Whatever boss you decide to face and whatever role you take on, the key thing is to form a well-balanced party with
  other players who share the same goal.</p>
<p><strong>And if enough of us play our cards right, this will not be the end of all times, but just the end of the
    times that were not fit for purpose.</strong></p>
<p>What does this mean for the Newmoonsletter? We don‚Äôt know. Let‚Äôs play and find out together, shall we?</p>
