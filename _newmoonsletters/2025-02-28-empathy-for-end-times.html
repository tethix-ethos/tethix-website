<p>Yet again we write a letter for the New Moon, the time in each lunar cycle when the Moon passes in front of the Sun
  and gets its far side tanned. Back here on Earth, this means our nights are the darkest, allowing us to see the stars
  more clearly. Because of the clarity that emerges in the dark sky, each New Moon is a good time for setting intentions
  for the next cycle.</p>
<p>Does it feel weird to be reading about the Moon’s cycles when we’re being bombarded by emergencies and breaking news?
  We thought it might be comforting to remember that our beloved Moon is basking in sunshine not too far from us while
  our nights are darkest – both literally and metaphorically of late.</p>
<p>Now, before you run off to deal with the next emergency in your life, we’d like to invite you to sit with us for a
  few minutes. Because we feel like you deserve a moment of empathy for yourself and those around you.</p>
<p>Look, we even made a template you can pass off as doing user research at work! If anyone were to glance over your
  shoulder at the office you might have been forced to return to, all they’ll see is a legit-looking empathy map: </p>
<a href="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/empathy-map-for-end-times.webp"><img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/empathy-map-for-end-times.webp" alt="Empathy Map for End Times canvas with a head and several guiding questions about what the head sees, smells, says, hears others saying, is doing, and what is weighing it down."></a>
<p>Unlike the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/">empathy map</a> you might have encountered in
  your design thinking or product development, the map you see above isn’t about getting into the head of your “target
  audience” (an awful phrase you probably shouldn’t be using unless you’re in the military) and understanding how you
  can sell people more stuff they don’t need.</p>
<p>Instead, the <strong>Empathy Map for End Times</strong> invites you to spend a bit of time in your own head – and
  body – to reflect on how you’re dealing with what feel like end times.</p>
<p>Wait, what? Spending time alone with your thoughts and – even worse! – feelings, what a horrifying way to spend these
  dark nights – and days! But you, dear human, deserve some empathy today. Wherever you are, and whenever today is for
  you, you deserve a chance to take a deep breath, and make a note of what your senses are capturing right now, what
  your brain is busy processing, what your entire body is metabolising at this moment in time.</p>
<p>You don’t have to do it <em>right now</em>. Maybe save the map for when you can set some time aside, either on your
  own or with somebody you feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>But you see that part of the map at the top? We reserved that top part, the above-head space for all the
  expectations, old ways of doing things, the external pressures that are weighing you down, making you smaller, making
  it difficult to move or even breathe.</p>
<p>Once you figure out what all of those things are, it’s time to let some of that weight go. It’s ok, really. And don’t
  even think of it as letting go. Think of it as <em>making space</em>. For dreams and hopes that can reach further than
  you ever thought possible. Because there is nothing holding you down when you decide to let go. (Except for gravity,
  but that’s a topic for another Newmoonsletter.)</p>
<p>If it helps, make a list of things that you <em>want</em> to let go of. And then a list of things you want to make
  more space for. Don’t limit yourself. This is not a to-do list to check off in a day, a lunation, or even a solar
  cycle. Just write, sing, draw, shout your <em>to-let-go-of</em> and <em>to-make-space-for</em> intentions in whatever
  way feels right to you.</p>
<p>If you need some ideas, feel free to borrow from our lists below.</p>
<h3>💩 Our to-let-go-of list:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Waiting for systemic fixes from above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shaming each other for imperfect decisions we’re forced to make.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowing differences that do no harm to divide us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Buying our way out of discomfort.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowing old habits and life scripts to hold us back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reading or watching the same horrible news for hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shouting “How dare they!” into the void of social media.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>External metrics of success.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technology that isolates us.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>🌱 Our to-make-space-for list:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Community building and collective futurecrafting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kindness towards others and ourselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expressing and processing uncomfortable feelings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Healing and dreaming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mending and repairing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Singing and dancing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being informed and asking “What can I do?” and “Who can I talk to?”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exploring collective action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hugging trees, petting moss.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being weird and publishing that draft.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Walking on uneven, unpaved paths to strengthen our ankles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sitting by rivers, lakes, ponds, seas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Listening to bird songs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sharing radicles of bold ideas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technology that connects us.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>See how much longer and – even more importantly – fulfilling the to-make-space-for list is? That’s because it’s
  actually more exciting to imagine things that bring us joy and hope.</p>
<p>And we know that letting go is hard, even when the to-let-go-of list is shorter. <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion">Loss aversion</a> is a known cognitive bias. But there really is
  so much more we can make space for. Especially if we embark on this process together.</p>
<p>Part of this is also using collaborative and social technologies in ways that make more space for the nourishing and
  less for things that make you feel bad about yourself and our collective chances for survival. This doesn’t mean
  looking away from injustice. It means stepping up with greater empathy and kindness. It means <a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/an-invitation-to-play_-for-end-times">playing for end times</a> like our lives
  depend on it – because they do.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re not part of the minorities that are currently being othered and persecuted. But (re)read the poem <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_They_Came">First They Came</a>. Eventually, the knock arrives at your door
  and there might be nobody left to speak up for you.</p>
<p>But we’re not letting it come to that. The movement for hatred and exclusion has gained massive momentum around the
  world. We need to craft an equally – if not stronger – movement of love to counter that. Not alone, together.</p>
<p>Time to put your fellowship together, pathfinder. A fellowship of love, a fellowship of the planet Earth.</p>
<p>With 💜 &amp; 🙂 from the Tethix campfire,<br>Alja and Mat</p>
