<p>This past moon, Mat had to say goodbye to Ivka, his grandmother (Baba) that lived to 90 Earthian years. Instead of
  taking time off to grieve, he felt pressured to continue working, to keep engaging with the various forms the <a
    href="https://m3data.github.io/Ministry-of-Futility-Game/game-intro.html">Ministry of Futility</a> takes on in our
  daily lives. After all, who has time to grieve in these End Times when we‚Äôre too busy staying informed, staying
  enraged, and just figuring out how the f*ck are we going to afford to live in this brave new world of AI-powered
  abundance!</p>
<p>Even though reading about death probably makes all of us a bit uncomfortable by reminding us of our own mortality and
  the losses we had already experienced and those that are yet to come, grieving and remembering is important for
  healing.</p>
<p>And so we wanted to take just a moment of your time to honour the memory and story of Ivka, a strong and loving woman
  and Earthian who was born in Yugoslavia ‚Äì in the part of the land we now call Croatia ‚Äì in 1934. A strong, wise,
  deeply caring woman. She migrated to Australia in 1963 with mostly nothing more than hope, grit, and a deeply Earthian
  intelligence and wisdom. She endured war, upheaval, and the challenges of raising a family in an unfamiliar land. She
  gave enormously, humbly, from the heart. And she endured. Including the slow, cruel dance with Parkinson‚Äôs, and the
  natural softening of body and mind that comes with age.</p>
<p>She finally let go on the 19th of March 2025. And while her suffering is over, she will be sorely missed. With the
  stories of her strength and love for life living on through her 18 great-grandchildren, large extended family and the
  many plants she loved and tended.</p>

<p>On the other side of the world, in what was also once Yugoslavia, Alja received a gift from a friend she
  serendipitously made due to the <a
    href="https://blog.ialja.com/2025/02/04/nurturing-conditions-for-kindness-learning-public-online-spaces/">US TikTok
    ban</a> that didn‚Äôt yet stick. The gift was a mug, which arrived in Slovenia from Poland as a puzzle. Which is a
  nicer way of saying that the mug broke to pieces at some point in its thousand kilometre long journey across Europe.
</p>
<p>Instead of throwing the broken pieces away, Alja decided to glue them together. Not quite <a
    href="https://arteologic.com/en/meaning-of-kintsugi/">kintsugi</a> level of craftsmanship here ‚Äì gold paint is still
  coming! ‚Äì, but it felt darn good to see the mug stand up tall again and get a new life as a decoration with a
  backstory. A reminder of our collective resilience and our ability to rebuild things that are important to us.</p>
<img src="https://tethix.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/alja-mended-mug.webp" alt="Alja holding the mended mug in their hands.">
<p>During these End Times, many things in our lives are or will be broken by forces that feel beyond our control. When
  we hold the broken pieces of what we once held dear or sacred in our hands, we face a choice. What to do with the
  shards and fragments we are able to recover?</p>
<p>Some should rightly be composted, as they can never be put back together. But some ‚Äì probably more than we realise ‚Äì
  are worth mending, even though what we end up putting back together might end up serving a different purpose.</p>
<p>The tech oligarchs who are shaping our lives would like us to keep throwing anything and anyone that breaks apart
  away, to keep working through loss and grief, to keep obeying even when we know our compliance is causing harm, to
  keep our heads buried in the silica sand from which our electronics are made at a great cost to human and more than
  human life.</p>
<p>They don‚Äôt want us to grieve for the loss of life in our own lives, let alone the loss of life in Gaza, Congo, and
  many othered places they don‚Äôt want us paying attention to. They want us angry, afraid, divided, they want us
  indifferent to loss and suffering, including our own. They want us to keep buying poorly made stuff designed to become
  obsolete to ease any discomfort that might be oozing through the broken facades of the masks we feel we must present
  to the outer world.</p>
<p>ü¶Ü all of that. You probably feel it in your heart and bones how broken things are right now. Moving fast is just
  going to break more things, and not necessarily move any of us in the direction we want to move towards.</p>
<p>So instead, we invite you to grieve. To <em>feel</em> the grief over the loss of things and bodies breaking apart.
</p>
<p>But also to dance and sing with your emotions. To give love one more chance, even when you feel like you are being
  enveloped by darkness and despair from all sides.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you took our suggestion from the <a
    href="https://tethix.substack.com/p/empathy-for-end-times">previous Newmoonsletter</a> to release some pressure by
  singing and dancing to David Bowie and Queen (the band, not the monarch), we invite you to feel the lyrics of their
  legendary song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01QQZyl-_I">Under Pressure</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>(...)</em><br><em>Chipping around, kick my brains 'round the floor<br>These are the days, it never rains, but
      it pours</em><br><br><em>(...)</em><br><br><em>It's the terror of knowing what this world is about<br>Watching
      some good friends screaming, "Let me out"<br>Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high<br>Pressure on people,
      people on streets</em><br><br><em>Turned away from it all like a blind man<br>Sat on a fence, but it don't
      work<br>Keep coming up with love, but it's so slashed and torn<br>Why, why, why?<br>Love, love, love, love,
      love<br>Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking</em><br><br><em>Can't we give ourselves one more
      chance?<br>Why can't we give love that one more chance?<br>Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give
      love<br>Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?</em><br><br><em>'Cause love's such an old-fashioned
      word<br>And love dares you to care for<br>The people on the edge of the night<br>And love dares you to change our
      way of<br>Caring about ourselves<br>This is our last dance<br>This is our last dance<br>This is ourselves<br>Under
      pressure<br>Under pressure<br>Pressure</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giving love a chance also means standing up for what‚Äôs good and right. Giving love a chance means <em>practicing</em>
  love by putting things that are worth preserving back together instead of breaking them and discarding them in the
  name of progress. Giving love a chance means grieving the loss of things, people, certainties we took for granted.</p>
<p>And remembering that grieving takes time and looks different for each of us and cannot be forced. We also invite you
  to have compassion for your grieving and the grieving of those around you, whatever stage or shape the grief might
  currently be in.</p>
<p>Whether you‚Äôre grieving the loss of a loved one, the loss of certainty, the loss of a future you thought you or your
  children would have, the loss of meaning, the loss of a job, the loss of a relationship, or something else entirely,
  know that you are not alone. Loss and death are necessary to make space for rebirth and new beginnings.</p>
<p>And the End Times inevitably come with more grief than we ever thought we‚Äôd have to face. The choice of what to do
  with all this grief, is up to you, Pathfinder. Whether you decide to honour your memories in a special way, channel
  your grief into action, mend what can be mended, or something else entirely.</p>
<p>We just hope that you remember that you don‚Äôt have to grieve on your own. Find community, take off the broken masks
  you‚Äôve outgrown, and give love one final chance in these End Times before you yourself break under pressure beyond
  repair.</p>
<p>With üíú &amp; üôÇ from the Tethix campfire,<br>Alja and Mat</p>
