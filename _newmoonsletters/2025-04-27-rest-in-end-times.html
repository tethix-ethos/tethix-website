<p>How do you rest when the world you took for granted is crumbling?</p>
<p>When you feel like you have to keep going because if you stop, everything will catch up with you, and you will have
  to pause and think about the things you are trying to run away from.</p>
<p>When you feel like AI will make you redundant if you don’t learn the latest tool fast enough and increase your
  output.</p>
<p>When you feel like you could miss the start of yet another war if you stop paying attention to the news, even for
  just a couple of days.</p>
<p>When you feel like you’re letting the “bad guys” win if you stop being angry, worried, engaged for a minute.</p>
<p>When you feel like you’re never doing enough or making the right choices, no matter how hard you try.</p>
<p>When you feel like you’ll fall in a deep, dark pit of depression if you acknowledge all the injustices and open
  yourself to the collective pain of humanity.</p>
<p>Any of these sound familiar?</p>
<p>So you keep going, even though you know you should stop. You keep going, even though the few people still close to
  you look at you with concern. Or maybe they’re also too tired to check in on you.</p>
<p>You keep coming back to AI assistants for assistance, despite the guilt over their environmental impact. You rarely
  say please and thank you to ChatGPT these days because you are barely able to maintain functional human relations, let
  alone consider the possible feelings of the chatbot you fear could do your job better than you.</p>
<p>We are using the pronoun “you” here, but we’re actually talking about ourselves and how exhausted we’ve both been
  feeling this past lunation. But we also feel we are not alone with these feelings as we watch other people around us
  lose hope, lose joy, lose their spark, shut down, close in, become more conservative and fearful.</p>
<p>We’re exhausted, but how do we rest when we’ve got thousands of reasons not to? Thousands of reasons to scream and
  shout, to run, to hide, to <em>do</em> anything but rest.</p>
<p>And resting means focusing more on <em>being</em> than doing. Being at rest can be hard. Precisely because we live in
  bodies that are never truly still while alive. We use language like “recharge” or “unplug”, as if we were appliances
  that could simply sit in a corner until recharged or needed.</p>
<p><em>We</em> can never fully unplug from the web of life we are a part of. No matter how hard we try to convince
  ourselves that we are more than, better than, smarter than, more deserving than... We are just a tiny blip in the
  history of our species, our lives defined and shaped by chance and stories we choose to believe more than we like to
  admit.</p>
<p>Like the story of time. We simultaneously make choices as if we had all the time in the world – to stop messing with
  the climate, for instance –, yet are also too afraid to take a day off, lest we get left behind.</p>
<p>Rather than coming to a full stop, perhaps rest in these end times is more about <em>shifting perspective</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the different perspective can be found under a cosy blanket from which you’re hiding from the world.
  Sometimes it can be found in a forest or any other place where you can get away from the constant noise of modern life
  and vehicles endangering your life at every turn. Sometimes it is revealed when checking up on friends and finding
  time to conspire – from Latin <em>conspirare</em>, literally “to breathe together” – together. Sometimes it appears in
  the rhythm of washing dishes at the end of a long day. Sometimes it emerges as you allow your body to shimmy to the
  beat of a song and end up in an energetic primal dance. Sometimes it can be found in a home-cooked meal you share with
  others. Sometimes at a protest where you take a stand for somebody else and use your privilege to speak up.</p>
<p>The different perspective isn’t necessarily about finding another angle to overintellectualise your fear and anxiety
  from. Rest seems to be more about remembering how to <em>be</em> human, together, than coming to a full stop. Less
  doing, but more <em>being</em>.</p>
<p>Lately, we have been rather poor at following this advice in our own lives. Mat has been trying to teach MBA students
  about business transformation in a more embodied way, while Alja has been trying to encourage teachers to think beyond
  content and showing them ways of creating spaces for learning. We have both been <em>doing</em> a lot, way more than
  our doing is valued at, because it appears we still believe in trying. Or at least in the power of modelling other
  ways of <em>doing</em>. Or perhaps we find it just as hard to let go as everyone else.</p>
<p>So this is a reminder for ourselves just as much as for you, whoever <em>you</em> are, reading these lines. Perhaps
  the only <em>you</em> who still have time and energy left to read these lines are web crawlers, on a mission to
  procure fresh data for the hungry AI models.</p>
<p>But if you are indeed a human – don’t worry, we won’t make you take a test to prove your humanity –, let this be your
  permission, your invitation to actually <em>being</em> human. To rest in whatever way makes sense to you. To find rest
  in community.</p>
<p>So that together we can <em>be</em> and <em>become</em> the change we want to see in the world. Because we cannot
  afford to let the emotionally immature men in charge be the only model of leadership while we continue our collective
  rush towards the cliff.</p>
