## **What is the problem we are solving at Tethix?**

Even when organisations articulate their good intentions in values and principles, they are not actionable nor translate into products that are brought to market. Cross-functional product teams building technology are usually under immense pressure to move fast and break things. This impacts trust and the organisationâ€™s social licence to operate. We call this **the ethical intent to action gap**.

## **What is the solution we are building to close this gap?**
