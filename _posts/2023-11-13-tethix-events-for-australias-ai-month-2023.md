Australia's [AI Month](https://www.csiro.au/en/work-with-us/industries/technology/National-AI-Centre/Australias-AI-Month) 2023 is running from the 15th of November to the 15th of December with a jam packed schedule! We're teaming up with [RSA Oceania](https://www.thersa.org/oceania) and [CoLabs](https://colabs.com.au/) to bring some unique events to the program that will excite, empower and educate.  
  
Check out the events below...  

## Mythopoetic sense making of our AI future

We invite you to be part of 'Mythopoetic Sense-Making of our AI Future', a transformative dialogue that dives into the narrative and symbolic layers of Artificial Intelligence, its history and its impact on society. This isn't just a technical conversation - it's an exploration into the stories, myths, and metaphors that AI brings into our collective consciousness. We'll use mythopoetic frameworks to unravel the complexities and ethical considerations surrounding AI, providing a richer, more nuanced understanding of its role in shaping our future.  
  
**When: Thu, 16 Nov 2023 09:30 - 12:00 AEDT**  
**Where: Co-Labs Melbourne and online**

## AI and Collective Futurecrafting

Join us for a pivotal virtual Yarning circle that intersects Artificial Intelligence with Collective Futurecrafting, exploring what this means for Australia's National Science and Research Priorities and beyond. This event is not just another conversation - it is a call to relational action to co-create a responsible and inclusive AI-enabled future that directly benefits Australia, its diverse communities and our biosphere.

We'll talk more about the Collective Futurecrafting Initiative and how AI technologies can support action at every level of our civilisation, from the household all the way to parliament.

**When: Tue, 21 Nov 2023 19:00 - 20:30 AEDT**  
**Where: online**

## Exploring the Gen AI Fire

Discover the transformative yet contentious realm of generative AI (Gen AI) in this 90 minute immersive workshop. Like Prometheus stealing fire from the gods, Gen AI offers us a tool of incomprehensible power and potential. But how should we handle this fire? Should we let it burn wildly, use it sparingly, or douse it entirely?

Guided by the metaphorical story of fire, we take you on a philosophical and practical journey to explore how to respond to and steward this potent technology responsibly. We navigate the spectrum of innovation and caution, teaching you to be a responsible firekeeper of the Gen AI flame.

**When: Tue 28th Nov 2023, 9:00 - 10:30 AEDT**  
**Where: online**

Cost per person: 99 AUD (approx. 64 USD / 60 EUR)
