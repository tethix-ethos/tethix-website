As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the **Pathfinders Newmoonsletter** rises in your inbox again to inspire collective [pathfinding](https://tethix.co/pathfinders) towards better tech futures.

**In this lunation** , uncle Sam, Mark and others need you to feed their AI golem armies, while we focus on sharing recipes for home-made software, look for plurality & weirdness online, challenge AI companies to actually think different, invite you to take a walk, and plant additional seeds of inspiration.

You can now **read the June 2024 issue** on our website in the [Newmoonsletter Archive](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#newmoonsletter-archive), or on Substack in [Tethix Pathfinding](https://tethix.substack.com/s/pathfinders-newmoonsletter).

The question that emerged from this moon's dance with the lunacy of tech is: **How can we prompt biased AI assistants to help us think different and imagine diverse tech futures?**

We'll be exploring this and other adjacent topics around the virtual campfire during our next [Full Moon Gathering](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#full-moon)**on Friday, June 21 at 5PM AEST / 9AM CEST**. If you'd like to join us for the discussion, don't forget to [RSVP](https://lu.ma/jgzxt4ks).

The **next Newmoonsletter** will rise again during the next new moon. Until then, remember to refill your water flasks, take as many fully offline walks as you can, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell. Thereâ€™s magic in both.

And if you want to make sure you don't miss the next issue of the most lunatic tech newsletter, you can subscribe to the Newmoonsletter either on our [website](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#subscribe) or on [Substack](https://tethix.substack.com/) (where you can also follow our other long-form content and the [Pathfinders Podcast](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast)), or add our blog or Substack publication to your RSS reader.
