As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the **Pathfinders Newmoonsletter** rises in your inbox again to inspire collective [pathfinding](https://tethix.co/pathfinders) towards better tech futures.

**In this lunation** , we try to escape the AI rat race by slowing down and playing with time. We listen for storms brewing in the distance while harvesting corn that might reveal more diverse rainbow visions of our tech futures.

You can now **read the June 2024 issue** on our website in the [Newmoonsletter Archive](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#newmoonsletter-archive), or on Substack in [Tethix Pathfinding](https://tethix.substack.com/s/pathfinders-newmoonsletter).

The question that emerged from this moon's dance with the lunacy of tech is: **What should we do with the time that new technologies save?**

We'll be exploring this and other adjacent topics around the virtual campfire during our next [Full Moon Gathering](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#full-moon)**on Monday, June 22 at 5PM AEST / 9AM CEST**. If you'd like to join us for the discussion, don't forget to [RSVP](https://lu.ma/wqi04s08).

The **next Newmoonsletter** will rise again during the next new moon. Until then, pop some rainbow corn, take the time to sign & dance with your loved ones, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell. Thereâ€™s magic in both.

And if you want to make sure you don't miss the next issue of the most lunatic tech newsletter, you can subscribe to the Newmoonsletter either on our [website](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#subscribe) or on [Substack](https://tethix.substack.com/) (where you can also follow our other long-form content and the [Pathfinders Podcast](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast)), or add our blog or Substack publication to your RSS reader.
