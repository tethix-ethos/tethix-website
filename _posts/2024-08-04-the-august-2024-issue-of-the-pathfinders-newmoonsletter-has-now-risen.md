As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the **Pathfinders Newmoonsletter** rises in your inbox again to inspire collective [pathfinding](https://tethix.co/pathfinders) towards better tech futures.

**In this lunation** , we coddiwomple towards a harmonious future in which AIs and humans form a mutually beneficial creative alliance by exploring the context in which we all live, and wondering who and what to place our faith in.

You can now **read the August 2024 issue** on our website in the [Newmoonsletter Archive](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#newmoonsletter-archive), or on Substack in [Tethix Pathfinding](https://tethix.substack.com/s/pathfinders-newmoonsletter).

The question that emerged from this moon's dance with the lunacy of tech is: **Should we use AI chatbots as mediators in human affairs?**

We'll be exploring this and other adjacent topics around the virtual campfire during our next [Full Moon Gathering](https://lu.ma/ehxmpuxr)**on Monday, August 19 at 5PM AEST / 9AM CEST**. If you'd like to join us for the discussion, don't forget to [RSVP](https://lu.ma/ehxmpuxr).

The **next Newmoonsletter** will rise again during the next new moon. Until then, be nice to your AI collaborators, find some shade underneath your local trees, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell. Thereâ€™s magic in both.

And if you want to make sure you don't miss the next issue of the most lunatic tech newsletter, you can subscribe to the Newmoonsletter either on our [website](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#subscribe) or on [Substack](https://tethix.substack.com/) (where you can also follow our other long-form content and the [Pathfinders Podcast](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast)), or add our blog or Substack publication to your RSS reader.
