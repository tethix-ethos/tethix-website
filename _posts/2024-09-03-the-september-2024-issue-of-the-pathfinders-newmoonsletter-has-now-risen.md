As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the **Pathfinders Newmoonsletter** rises in your inbox again to inspire collective [pathfinding](https://tethix.co/pathfinders) towards better tech futures.

**In this lunation** , Big Tech still refuses to embrace the demure and mindful trend, while we sing to a burning planet, explore some recent research on LLMs, and wonder whether AI chatbots could help us get our sh*t together.

You can now **read the September 2024 issue** on our website in the [Newmoonsletter Archive](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#newmoonsletter-archive), or on Substack in [Tethix Pathfinding](https://tethix.substack.com/s/pathfinders-newmoonsletter).

The question that emerged from this moon's dance with the lunacy of tech is: **How do we embrace the lunacy of tech with playfulness?**

We'll be exploring this and other adjacent topics around the virtual campfire during our next [Full Moon Gathering](https://lu.ma/p1qpjenn)**on Wednesday, September 18 at 5PM AEST / 9AM CEST**. If you'd like to join us for the discussion, don't forget to [RSVP](https://lu.ma/p1qpjenn).

The **next Newmoonsletter** will rise again during the next new moon. Until then, build some communication bridges, get to know the trees in your neighborhood, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell. Thereâ€™s magic in both.

And if you want to make sure you don't miss the next issue of the most lunatic tech newsletter, you can subscribe to the Newmoonsletter either on our [website](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#subscribe) or on [Substack](https://tethix.substack.com/) (where you can also follow our other long-form content and the [Pathfinders Podcast](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast)), or add our blog or Substack publication to your RSS reader.
