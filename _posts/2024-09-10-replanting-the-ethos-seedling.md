Earlier this year, we [launched](https://tethix.co/fire/meet-ethos-a-seedling-for-reflective-tech-practice-with-big-dreams/) the ETHOS seedling app as a responsible tech journey companion. The scorching AI summer and drought hasn’t been favorable to seedlings like ours, so we have now decided to replant it in more fertile soil where it will need fewer additional resources to survive.

We are grateful to all pathfinders who visited and nurtured the seedling in its initial iteration in the past months. Unfortunately, the seedling was starting to dry out due to lack of nutrients – especially funding. With AI chatbots hijacking everyone’s attention and our refusal to use quick-fix fertilizers, the ETHOS seedling was slowly withering away in hostile soil without the necessary support.

But we were reluctant to give up. Instead, we decided to replant the ETHOS seedling and prune it in ways that will be easier for us to nurture. The replanted seedling also has the benefit of being less resource intensive. We’re now happy to report that the [seedling](https://ethos.tethix.co/) appears to be doing much better in its new environment, and has even sprouted a couple of new leaves!

**The replanted version of ETHOS** still allows you to browse and explore:

* [elemental sparks](https://ethos.tethix.co/sparks/) to **inspire discussions** and explore shared meanings,
* the [seed catalog](https://ethos.tethix.co/seed-catalog/) of **principles and guidelines** that can inform your ethical journey,
* and [tools and techniques](https://ethos.tethix.co/tools/) you can use to **transform your practice**.

Additionally, you can now:

* **take a seat underneath the ETHOS tree** to pause and take a moment to [reflect](https://ethos.tethix.co/reflect/),
* and look into different [Tethix mirrors](https://ethos.tethix.co/mirrors) to **explore future paths**.

No account needed, no personal data collected, no tracking. If you’re friendly with the Terminal, you can even make ETHOS your own by cloning or forking the [repository](https://github.com/tethix-ethos/ethos-jekyll).

The ETHOS seedling is still just a tiny part of [our vision](https://tethix.co/product-ethos/). We’re also finding that sometimes taking a step back can actually bring you closer to your destination. Despite its limitations and simplicity – or perhaps because of it –, we still hope [ETHOS](https://ethos.tethix.co/) inspires pathfinding, curiosity, reflection, and smiles.

And you can help ETHOS grow bigger – at a reasonable pace – by sharing it with friends and colleagues. And if you have any feedback, questions, or suggestions, send us your thoughts at [ethos@tethix.co](mailto:ethos@tethix.co) or start a [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/tethix-ethos/ethos-jekyll/discussions).
