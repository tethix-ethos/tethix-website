A new episode of the [Pathfinders Podcast](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast) is now available wherever you get your podcasts. In the latest episode, we dance with the question: [**How do we embrace the lunacy of tech with playfulness? (And lessons from Middle-earth.)**](https://tethix.substack.com/p/how-do-we-embrace-the-lunacy-of-tech)

In this episode, we go there and back again to where our unexpected journey began. Twelve moon cycles ago, we started writing the Pathfinders Newmoonsletter both as a satire of the tech industry and an invitation to embrace its lunacy with smiles and love. But that’s often easier said than done. Especially as the power of the fire practitioners of Silicon Valley continues to increase, and their actions grow more absurd and destructive.

History teaches us that absurdity and unchecked power are often best countered with humor and playfulness. From court jesters speaking truth to power, to mythological tricksters like Loki and Anansi undermining authority, to carnivals turning social roles upside down, even if just for a day. Playfulness can be found at the heart of exploring what’s possible and challenging business as usual that’s no longer working for us.

Especially when playfulness is paired with a good story. During our Full Moon Gathering, we discovered a path that led from our guiding question to Middle-earth. Yes, that Middle-earth, the home of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and other fantastical creatures imagined by Tolkien and later adapted in The Lord of the Rings movies and other media. The Middle-earth that gave us, nerds, a rich set of stories, metaphors, and archetypes we can now draw upon.

So, as the Sarumans, Saurons, Sams, and Marcs of Silicon Valley continue to beat their drums of progress in the pursuit of the One Ring of AGI to rule us all, the guiding question for today’s exploration is: How do we embrace the lunacy of tech with playfulness? (And some lessons from Middle-earth.)

We also wonder, how does play emerge? How do we bend and break the rules of the game? How do we find humor in what feel like hopeless times? How do we find our own journey, story, and fellowship?
