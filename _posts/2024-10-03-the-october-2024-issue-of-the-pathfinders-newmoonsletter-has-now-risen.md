As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the **Pathfinders Newmoonsletter** rises in your inbox again to inspire collective [pathfinding](https://tethix.co/pathfinders) towards better tech futures.

**In this lunation** , we try to reason with strawberries, look for human and AI companions for our fellowship, and try out tools that might just help us find paths that lead to preferable futures.

You can now **read the October 2024 issue** on our website in the [Newmoonsletter Archive](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#newmoonsletter-archive), or on Substack in [Tethix Pathfinding](https://tethix.substack.com/s/pathfinders-newmoonsletter).

The question that emerged from this moon's dance with the lunacy of tech is: **Why aren’t more people using conversational interfaces for conversational learning?**

We'll be exploring this and other adjacent topics around the virtual campfire during our next [Full Moon Gathering](https://lu.ma/8waf9hg6)**on**Thursday, October 17 at 6PM AEDT / 9AM CEST****. If you'd like to join us for the discussion, don't forget to [RSVP](https://lu.ma/8waf9hg6).

The **next Newmoonsletter** will rise again during the next new moon. Until then, keep looking for your fellowship, explore cross-species collaboration, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell. There’s magic in both.

And if you want to make sure you don't miss the next issue of the most lunatic tech newsletter, you can subscribe to the Newmoonsletter either on our [website](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#subscribe) or on [Substack](https://tethix.substack.com/) (where you can also follow our other long-form content and the [Pathfinders Podcast](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast)), or add our blog or Substack publication to your RSS reader.
