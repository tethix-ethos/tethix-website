A new episode of the [Pathfinders Podcast](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast) is now available wherever you get your podcasts. In the latest episode, we dance with the question: [**Why aren’t more people using AI conversational interfaces for conversational learning?**](https://tethix.substack.com/p/why-arent-more-people-using-ai-conversational)

In this episode, we wanted to explore the conversational side of our AI companions. When it comes to AI capabilities, most of the focus in tech remains on productivity gains and even imaginary superpowers such as [“fixing the climate”](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/28/1104588/sorry-ai-wont-fix-climate-change/), as Sam Altman and other techno-optimists with doomsday bunkers like to prophesize. 

Meanwhile, existing conversational powers of AI tools are often sidelined. Conversational capabilities are mainly discussed in the context of [persuasiveness risk assessments](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-system-card/), or as part of Black Mirror visions of people developing intimate relationships with AIs, in the style of the movie Her and others. 

And while conversations are indeed crucial for relationship-building, we haven’t yet seen that many discussions about conversational learning. Not in the context of AI tutors helping students prepare for exams. But conversational learning as a natural human technology for making sense of our world, improving collaboration, and nurturing our imagination. In short, the skills we need to face our current [meta-crisis](https://www.humanetech.com/insights/a-deeper-dive-into-the-meta-crisis). 

During our discussion, we ponder about the history of conversational interfaces, our existing mental models, and the design of our spaces and systems that make it challenging to make time and space for conversational learning in our daily lives. We explore the human yearning for a yarn and invite you not just to “think outside the box”, but to step outside the boxes and forms of linear thinking and standardized testing to embrace embodied conversational learning, especially thought voice interfaces. Both with humans and LLM-based AI assistants.
