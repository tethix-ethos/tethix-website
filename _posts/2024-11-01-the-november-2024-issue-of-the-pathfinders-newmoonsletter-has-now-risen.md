As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the **Pathfinders Newmoonsletter** rises in your inbox again to inspire collective [pathfinding](https://tethix.co/pathfinders) towards better tech futures.

**In this lunation** , we wonder how AI agents will deal with cookie consent banners, explore both human and AI conversational powers – and responsibilities –, and invite you to visit a library.

You can now **read the November 2024 issue** on our website in the [Newmoonsletter Archive](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#newmoonsletter-archive), or on Substack in [Tethix Pathfinding](https://tethix.substack.com/s/pathfinders-newmoonsletter).

The question that emerged from this moon's dance with the lunacy of tech is: **How intelligent do AI companions actually need to be?**

We'll be exploring this and other adjacent topics around the virtual campfire during our next [Full Moon Gathering](https://lu.ma/dar6lt94)**on**Friday, November 15 at 7PM AEDT / 9AM CET****. If you'd like to join us for the discussion, don't forget to [RSVP](https://lu.ma/dar6lt94).

The **next Newmoonsletter** will rise again during the next new moon. Until then, find some time and space for conversations, visit your local library, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell. There’s magic in both.

And if you want to make sure you don't miss the next issue of the most lunatic tech newsletter, you can subscribe to the Newmoonsletter either on our [website](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#subscribe) or on [Substack](https://tethix.substack.com/) (where you can also follow our other long-form content and the [Pathfinders Podcast](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast)), or add our blog or Substack publication to your RSS reader.
