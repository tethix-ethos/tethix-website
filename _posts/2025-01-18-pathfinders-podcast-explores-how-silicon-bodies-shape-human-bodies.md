A new episode of the [Pathfinders Podcast](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast) is now available wherever you get your podcasts. In the latest episode, we dance with the question: [**How do our human bodies fit into an AI-enabled future?**](https://tethix.substack.com/p/how-do-our-human-bodies-fit-into)

In this episode, we want to shift our attention back to our human bodies. Which seems fitting for the first episode of 2025, a year in which we can longer take our bodily autonomy for granted. 

A year in which it’s painfully obvious how different the rules are for bodies with a high Net Worth than for the rest of us who can barely afford to play Monopoly as a board game. A year in which the Zucks and other rich fucks continue to pit our bodies against each other and AI bots because all they care about are engagement stats, not actual human connection. A year in which an app that allows bodies to collectively share lived experiences is considered a threat to national security.

So perhaps it is a radical act in 2025 to re-ground and re-root back into our bodies. In the special [Black Moon edition](https://tethix.substack.com/p/pathfinders-newmoonsletter-black) of our Newmoonsletter, we wrote:

_“The fire practitioners of Silicon Valley might consider our bodies a bug in the system, a flaw to eliminate. We’re inviting you to reconnect with your body and the bodies around you, and be curious about everything our bodies can do that defies logic and cannot (yet) be imitated by software running on silicon._

_And to pay attention to what is happening to all our bodies as we spend an increasing amount of time in companionship with silicon bodies. And how different our bodies – both human and more than human – feel when they connect with each other through direct touch.”_

Through our discussion, we explore how language shapes and is shaped by different bodies, how different technologies – not just digital ones – shape our bodies, and even touch upon the role psychedelic technologies might play in finding more trauma-informed ways of building tech. 

We also explore the future transhumanism and other ideologies from the [TESCREAL bundle](https://www.dair-institute.org/tescreal/) have in store for non-billionaire bodies, and use the [Three Horizons future framework](https://www.h3uni.org/foundational-insights/seeing-and-thinking-in-three-horizons/) to explore how we might collectively imagineer a viable future for our species.
