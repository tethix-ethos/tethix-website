As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the **Pathfinders Newmoonsletter** rises in your inbox. In this Newmoonsletter, we reflect on our journey so far, and explore how play might be what we need to match the absurdity of current end times.

You can now **read ðŸŒ‘** **An invitation to Play_ for End Times** on our website in the [Newmoonsletter Archive](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#newmoonsletter-archive), or on Substack in [Tethix Pathfinding](https://tethix.substack.com/s/pathfinders-newmoonsletter).

The guiding question that emerged under this New Moon is: **Whatâ€™s the role AI and digital tech could play in collective futurecrafting?**

We'll be exploring this and other adjacent topics around the virtual campfire during our next [Full Moon Gathering](https://lu.ma/ipo0hmb7)**on Wednesday, February 12, 2025, at 7PM AEDT / 9AM CET**. If you'd like to join us for the discussion, don't forget to [RSVP](https://lu.ma/ipo0hmb7).

The **next Newmoonsletter** will rise again during the next New Moon. Until then, find and create space for Play_ in your own life, in your communities. and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell. Thereâ€™s magic in both.
