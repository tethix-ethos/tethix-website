As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the **Pathfinders Newmoonsletter** rises in your inbox. In this Newmoonsletter, we invite you to make your to-let-go-of and to-make-space-for lists as you practice some empathy towards yourself in these dark times of transformation.

In this Newmoonsletter we introduce the **Empathy Map for End Times** , a tool you can use on your own or with others to process your emotions, thoughts, and actions during what feel like end times.

You can now **read ðŸŒ‘** **Empathy for End Times** on our website in the [Newmoonsletter Archive](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#newmoonsletter-archive), or on Substack in [Tethix Pathfinding](https://tethix.substack.com/s/pathfinders-newmoonsletter).

### Join us for the Full Moon Gathering

The guiding question that emerged under this New Moon is: **How do we compost our sh*t to create the soil for thriving?**

We'll be exploring this and other adjacent topics around the virtual campfire during our next [Full Moon Gathering](https://lu.ma/yh2ihlfi) **on Monday, March 17, 2025, at 7PM AEDT / 9AM CET**. If you'd like to join us for the discussion, don't forget to [RSVP](https://lu.ma/yh2ihlfi).

The **next Newmoonsletter** will rise again during the next New Moon. Until then, look up towards the Moon as you let go of the things you no longer need, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell. Thereâ€™s magic in both.

And if you want to make sure you don't miss the next issue, you can subscribe to the Newmoonsletter either on our [website](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#subscribe) or on [Substack](https://tethix.substack.com/) (where you can also follow our other long-form content and the [Pathfinders Podcast](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast)), or add our blog or Substack publication to your RSS reader.
