As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the **Pathfinders Newmoonsletter** rises in your inbox. In this Newmoonsletter, we share reflections on lives lost, mugs broken and repaired, and an invitation to give love one more chance before we collectively break under pressure beyond repair.

You can now read **ðŸŒ‘ Grieving for End Times** on our website in the [Newmoonsletter Archive](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#newmoonsletter-archive), or on Substack in [Tethix Pathfinding](https://tethix.substack.com/s/pathfinders-newmoonsletter).

### Join us for the Full Moon Gathering

The guiding question that emerged under this New Moon is:**Is it time to wean ourselves off role-playing as machines?**

We'll be exploring this and other adjacent topics around the virtual campfire during our next [Full Moon Gathering](https://lu.ma/457h6x9d)**on Monday, April 14, 2025, at 5PM AEST / 9AM CEST**. If you'd like to join us for the discussion, don't forget to [RSVP](https://lu.ma/457h6x9d).

The **next Newmoonsletter** will rise again during the next New Moon. Until then, make space and time for grieving, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell. Thereâ€™s magic in both.

And if you want to make sure you don't miss the next issue, you can subscribe to the Newmoonsletter either on our [website](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#subscribe) or on [Substack](https://tethix.substack.com/) (where you can also follow our other long-form content and the [Pathfinders Podcast](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast)), or add our blog or Substack publication to your RSS reader.
