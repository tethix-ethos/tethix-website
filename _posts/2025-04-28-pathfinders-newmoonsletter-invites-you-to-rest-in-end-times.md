As the moon completes another orbit around Earth, the **Pathfinders Newmoonsletter** rises in your inbox. In this Newmoonsletter, we wonder about the state and practice of rest in these end times.

You can now read **ðŸŒ‘ Rest in End Times** on our website in the [Newmoonsletter Archive](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#newmoonsletter-archive), or on Substack in [Tethix Pathfinding](https://tethix.substack.com/s/pathfinders-newmoonsletter).

### Join us for the Full Moon Gathering

This New Moon, we also invite you to join us for a **yarn about rest in end times**. We'll be exploring this and other adjacent topics around the virtual campfire during our next [Full Moon Gathering](https://lu.ma/b3ybogy7)**on Monday, May 12, 2025, at 5PM AEST / 9AM CEST**. If you'd like to join us for the discussion, don't forget to [RSVP](https://lu.ma/b3ybogy7).

The **next Newmoonsletter** will rise again during the next New Moon. Until then, make time for rest, and be mindful about the seeds of intention you plant and the stories you tell. Thereâ€™s magic in both.

And if you want to make sure you don't miss the next issue, you can subscribe to the Newmoonsletter either on our [website](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#subscribe) or on [Substack](https://tethix.substack.com/) (where you can also follow our other long-form content and the [Pathfinders Podcast](https://tethix.co/pathfinders/#podcast)), or add our blog or Substack publication to your RSS reader.
