  title="Our story"
  content="The initial seed for Tethix was planted in 2020 with Greater Than Learning, an online learning platform with courses on operationalising data ethics, trust & trustworthiness, and ethical design. The courses were practical and well-received. But we kept hearing from participants that more collaborative learning experiences were needed.

  Drawing from our diverse experience in teaching and instructional design, we shifted focus to explore a new kind of learning experience designed for how people learn best: by doing, together. In a complex field like tech ethics we know decision-making should be an inclusive, social process. We decided to create an active learning context to simulate this.

  In March 2022, we guided our first pilot fellowship on a unique exploration journey in tech ethics. Taking place as a collaborative simulation in the Tethix Archipelago. You can learn more about this pilot on [our blog](https://tethix.co/blog-articles/).

  But this is just the beginning of the adventure we want to embark on as we continue building tools like [ETHOS](https://tethix.co/product-ethos/) to make ethics accessible and practical in tech.

  Just a small taste of the experiences we want to design together with you. Yes, you. Because it will take diverse perspectives and more than our small team of firekeepers to imagine and pave the way to a better tech future."
