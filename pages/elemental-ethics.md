{% capture fire_intro %}
It's been happening now for months. There's a manic rush. Sensationalist reactions are the norm. **The fires of Generative AI are spreading.**

You've been playing with the fire too. As have your colleagues.

We've seen what is happening. We've lived it together. All we seem to hear about is how bad it might get. Or how damn right awesome it is and will be. But, there's an alternative.

**You can temper the flame.** You can benefit from its warmth and power, without being consumed by it.

Now's the time for your organisation to build a safe campfire.

The thing is, you don't have to look far. The discovery of responsible firekeeping has already been made. Tethix is here to share it with you, so let's sit around the campfire together.

  content="Technology is like fire. Exciting, powerful, but also unpredictable and dangerous. 
  
  By developing responsible firekeeping skills, you can learn how to build safer campfires for your products and reduce the risk of the fire spreading uncontrollably or dying out. 
  
  And you'll learn how to balance your fire with other elements:"

  Provide adequate ventilation for your fire by making space for developing shared meanings and psychological safety, helping conversations flow in all directions within your organisation. By developing a culture of open and diverse collaboration, you can build windbreaks that protect your fire from strong winds of shifting public opinion."

  title="This is Elemental Ethics"
  content="What we've just described is Elemental Ethics, a new type of ethics framework. It uses nature-inspired language and familiar stories to make ethics interesting, fun, accessible, inclusive, memorable, and practical. 
  
  Elemental Ethics is the culmination of decades of combined practice and research, born out of our own frustration with how products are designed and built. 
  
  It is the embodiment of SMILES, our blueprint for cultural change, designed to unravel complexity and nurture a profound kinship with the natural world."

The tech industry deserves something better than dusty values on walls. It's time for an approach to ethics that acknowledges the complexities of product development, and helps you build better products without accidentally starting fires all over the place.

Elemental Ethics| OVER| The Conventional  
---|---|---  
Living stories that grow with the organisation| OVER| Posters with values collecting dust on walls  
Useful in practice at all levels| OVER| Impressing stakeholders on a website  
Inspires conversation, curiosity, playfulness and action| OVER| Inspires boredom and does not close the intent to action gap  
Exploring the forest and nurturing trees| OVER| Looking at an idolised picture of the forest  
Awakens moral imagination| OVER| Too abstract to be relatable and applicable  
Forged by practitioners, mindful of each step and oriented to action| OVER| Led by consultants without first-hand experience of everyday ethical tensions in the field
