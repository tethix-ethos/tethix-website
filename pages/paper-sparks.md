{% capture finding-nature %}
A set of Elemental Sparks we developed for a **[Finding Nature event](https://events.humanitix.com/deceit-apathy-and-desperation-addressing-the-uncertain-harms-of-artificial-intelligence)** in Sydney on May 1, 2024. You can read more about how we used these sparks at the event on [our blog](https://tethix.co/air/how-a-playful-dance-with-the-elements-can-help-broaden-perspectives-on-ai-ethics/).

In this set, each spark includes **one blank space** for participants to write in their own discussion prompt and **one dance prompt** that invites participants to embody the element through dance.

We recommend using these Sparks when you want to spark conversations about **uncertain harms of artificial intelligence**. Keep in mind that the question prompts are just a starting point to explore the different meanings evoked by each of the spark words.

  title="What are Elemental Sparks?"
  content="Language is an elemental part of culture. Yet, we rarely take the time to explore the meaning behind words we use regularly. This often leads to tensions and misunderstandings, even when we have shared intents.

  Tethix Elemental Sparks are here to spark discussions, storytelling, and explorations into what common words mean to us.

  In a format that is likely to evoke childhood memories, Tethix Elemental Sparks are a printable interactive artefact designed to delight and invite exploration. Let chance guide your discussions as your fingers remember the playfulness you might have forgotten as an adult."

  title="How to use Elemental Sparks"

  Use Elemental Sparks in a professional setting to explore hidden aspects of your products, reveal tensions and commonalities within your team, or as an icebreaker and conversation starter.

  In any setting, Tethix Elemental Sparks can help you deepen your relationships and find or develop shared meanings.

  We also invite you to use the blank templates to make your own Sparks that fit your context and the words you want to explore together."
