  Over time, we aim to grow the ETHOS seedling into a thriving tech ethics forest by codesigning a complete Ethical Tension and Health Operating System (ETHOS), which will help organisations close the ethical intent to action gap. Explore [our product vision](https://tethix.co/product-ethos/) to find out more about our vision."
