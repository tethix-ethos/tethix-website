## What we believe

We believe that the data we collect and process should be stewarded. By us as an organisation and by the community we serve.

How we collect and process data, how it is managed and governed will also evolve with your involvement if you choose to engage in co-design activities. If you are interested in Data Coops and Data Trusts and want to collaborate, [reach out](mailto:data@tethix.co).

## Why we collect and process personal data

We collect and process personal data to be able to co-design Tethix with the community we serve.

### Purpose of processing

We collect and process personal data for the following purposes:

* To promote what we are doing and the co-design experiences we run with the community via our newsletter.

## When and what we collect and process

There are different situations when we collect and process data about you. Below we describe these situations, what data we collect and what other organisations are involved.

### When you browse the website

We have done our best to collect no personal data when you just browse as a visitor. Aligning to the principle of data minimisation. We use Plausible **privacy preserving web analytics**. There are no cookies or tracking pixels used so **no personal data is collected**.
