  Good intentions don't always lead to ethical actions. To close the intent to action gap, we need an approach to ethics that is embodied, contextual, and a living system within the organisation.

  Explore our vision for how ETHOS might evolve to close the ethical to action gap in your organisation.

  content="Dashboards are boring and forgettable. With ETHOS, the values, principles, or pledges your team decides to plant together will turn into a living ETHOS Garden.

  You will nurture your ETHOS Garden by practising [Elemental Ethics](https://tethix.co/elemental-ethics/) skills within ETHOS-enabled apps. The Garden will be a place that grows with your team, dynamically reacts to emerging tensions, and is a mirror of how healthy your responsible practice is.

  Connected together, ETHOS Gardens form a network that reflects the ethical health & tensions of the entire organisation."
